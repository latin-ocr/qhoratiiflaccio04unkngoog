noox 1.] THE ILLUSTRATIONS. 393

Apollo, ushered into his presence by Thetis, the Suu-god being designated
τΣιΛ, a variant of Ausel, which we know from Festus was his Sabine name,
and the origin of the patronymic Aurelius. On gem and mirror alike‚ o
replaces the Ionic Θ in the name of Neptune, without causing any confusion
in its own times; for this primitive alphabet‚ like the Semitic, had no cha-
racter for o, the v (vau) doing duty equally for o and ‘r- This is particularly
noticeable in the legend on the very common oes qrave of Volterra, written

. ΙἿΟΜΞἹ It was only on their most finished gem-works that the Etrus-
cans added these interesting explanatory inscriptions, and the present intaglio
stands in the first class of all hitherto discovered. Sard scarabeus found at
Vulci. (Durand‚ Imp. Gem. 111. 3.)

XV. Α. Tun Summum Psms, in his Phrygian cap and goatskin chlamys,
holding out the golden apple of Discord. This graceful specimen of the
Roman school so exactly expresses the mingled effeminacy and heroism mark-
ing the character of the Trojan youth, that its author may with reason be
supposed to have drawn his inspiration from that masterpiece of early Greek
sculpture thus graphically pictured to us by Pliny (xxxiv. 19, 16). “ Euphra-
noris Alexander Paris est, in quo laudatur quod omnia simul intelligantur, judex
Dearum, amator Helenae, et tamen Achillis interfector.” Sard. (Blacas.)

XV. a. Rouana, Mas-rna or 'rus Pammuu. The hero, having taken
down the statuette of Pallas from its elevated pedestal. is seen in the act of
descending from the altar, upon which he had climbed for that purpose. His
companion‚ Ulysses, vanishes beyond the altar, keeping watch in the far dis-
tance, which accounts for the disproportionate diminution of his figure. The
nude statue of Venus indicates the scene of the exploit‚ the acropolis of
Troy3 the moon and star overhead, the time, midnight3 the palm-branch at
Diomede’s side the successful termination of the adventure. 'I'he subject,
although treated with a general similarity to the well-known engravings by
Dioscorides and Gnaeus, yet presente some important variations, for in the latter
Diomede is seated at rest (a pose quite out of character with the requirements
of his critical situation), with the corpse of the slaughtered guardian at his
feet3 besides other differences in the accessaries. In design, therefore, this
gem strikes me as the first among-st the numerous antique representatione of
this favour-ite episode, and as sor'execution, 1 can justly apply to it the words
of Winckelmann, speaking· of a similar intaglio in the Stosch Cabinet:—
‘⁴ L’cntendement de l’art pour le detail et l’ensemhle des parties du corps
humain est mai-que ὲ. un plus haut degi-e de perfection qu’il ne l'est dans la
meme figure gravee meme par Dioscorides et par Gnaeus.”

Pliny, in his notice of the caelatores, and their mostimportant works, quotes
a silver chasing, emblema, by Pytheas, of “Ulysses and Diomede stealing
away the Palladium,” which, though only two ounces in weight‚ fetched the
enormous price of 10‚000 denarii (5:400). We may be sure that a copy of this
extraordinary work is preserved to us in some of the gems above mentioned,
