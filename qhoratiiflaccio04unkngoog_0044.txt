xxxiv INTRODUCTION

he always or generally so wrote it: see what Ι say on this
point in my Aetna n. to v. 5. Probably in prose they pro-
nounced it as an enclitic in such casce. But, to judge from
inscriptions, in more ancient times it was less frequently writ-
ten st, than afterwards: a Greek I presume would have pro·
nounced μουστί and μου ὲστίὶῃ the same way. Therefore Ι have
never printed it as an enclitic, except in the five instances
alluded to· Similarly in Epist. 11 2 163 I print ‘ modo isto ',
though probably it was pronounced modesta I could have
wished my authorities had allowed me to write the rela-
tive quidquid ‚- but the best MSS. so persistently give quic-
quid, that I have obeyed them: this form occurs too in the

very ancient Lex Rubria and elsewhere. ‘ Obprobrium ’ is
constantly attested by all our best MSS: ‘ Vemens’ I have

written in Epist. 11 2 120 for the ‘Vehemens' of MSS: Ι
should have done so in the other two instances where its
quantity is not shewn by its position, as in Horace‘s time it
could only be a dissyl.: perhaps too he always wrote ‘ repren-
dere ’ for ‘reprehendere ’ of MSS. as twice he certainly did:
our books all give us ‘ Polli0‚ Messala, paulum ’.

That the odes of Horace all consist of stanzas of four lineS‚
Ι neither affirm nor deny. We are so ignorant of the mode in
which his odes were recited‚ that, where the verses are all the
same as in the first ode, since there is no necessary pause at
the end of each quatrain, I hardly know what a stanza meane.
Therefore Ι have not marked any stanzas in printing, as in
odes evidently stanzaic they sufficiently declat-e themselves.
But Ι will now conclude.
