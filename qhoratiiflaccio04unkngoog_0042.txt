xxxii INTRODUCTION

aulul. 616 the miser boding- evil ories ‘ Non temere est quod
corvos cantat mihi nunc ab laeva manu’. Yet Orelh‘ reads
vetet and coolly remarks ‘ tenerior hic sensus videtur ’3 and
Macleane observes that vetet is required by the sense: he did
not hold that philology like philosophy begins in wonder, and
that it is perilous to contradict Lambinus and Bentley when
in conjunction.
Epod. 1 5 Ritter’s 6 si est' (write 6 sist ⁹) 6 superstite' for
‘ si superstite ⁹ or ‘superstite ’ of MSS. is probably right.
9 17 6 Ad hunc ' has most authority; but what Horace
did here write it is not possible to say: ad hunc may = ad
solem. 10 2 the old Bernese has 6 Maevium' ; but other
MS. authority in Horace and virgil is in favour of spelling
this worthy's name ‘Mevius '. Oarm. saec. 65 ‘aras ’ of
ant. Bland. and many MSS. is more exquisite than ‘ arces'.
Epist. 1 2 1 ‘ Maxime ’ Ι have written with Haupt and
others, as a proper name ι it was a very common cognomen, and
a P. Lollius Maximus appears in later times ε it cannot stand
thus isolated for 6 maxime natu ’ or ‘maxime fiat-rum! 5 12
6 Quo mihi fortuna ' of all the best MSS. I retain : comp. Aen.
lv 98 6 aut quo nunc certamine tanto ', and Conington’s note.
5 16 6 dissignat '‚ '7 6 6 Dissignatorem ⁹: inscriptions
and the best MSS. prove these to be the right spellings.
Ars 197 Ι see no reason for adopting the conjecture ‘ pacare
tumentes’. 394 ‘ urbis ’ is better attested than ‘ arcis '.

The manuscripts of Horace, with the partial exception per-
haps of the old Bernese, are not such safe guides in ortho-
graphy, as those of Virgil for instance or Lucretius. But in
Horace too, for reasons which I have fully stated in the intro-
duction to my Lucretius, Ι have clung as much as possible to
the best tradition preserved in the oldest MSS. especially
where we have the old Bernese: as instances of spellings un-
questionably right, though neglected in editions for the most
part, take the following: ‘ praegnaS, Danuvius, Paelignus,
paelex, raeda, scaena, Thraex’ as well as ‘ Thrax ’‚ ‘Zmyr-na,
