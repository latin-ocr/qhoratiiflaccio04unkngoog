428 DESCRIPTION OF [oum.

as the serpent, the cvl, and the mob.” Banded sardonyx. (Thorwddsen.
Imp. Gom. 1. 1.)

IV. A. Two Garruons nxvoumo A Sne. The most spirited composition
in the way of animal painting known to me in ancient glyptics. It may well
be a copy of some picture by Zeuxis, who is noted by Lucian for bis fondness
for similar unusual and imaginat-y subjects. 'l'he gryphen, combination of
the engle and lion, swistness with strength, is the appropriate emblem of the
sun-god, and due to the elegant fancy of the Greeks. The Delphic tradition
taught that the worship of Apollo had been planted there by the Hyperboreum
(a nation placed to the east of Scythia), Opis and Arge, Hyperborean maidens,
having accompanied Apollo when he first took up his abode at Delphi. Offer-
ings‚ packed in straw, continued to be transmitted thither fr01n the far-
distant source, being passed on from one nation to another, in their “ausit
westward‚ down to tbe times of Herodotus. Now, as the grypbon was be-
lieved a native of the same remote region, it is easy to perceive why he should
have followed the oriental god in his migration. Sard. (Dr. N ott. Imp.
Gem. 111. 91.)

IV. u. Densus, a pertrait taken in his boyhood. The resemblance to the
young heads of Augustus is very striking, and, in fact, it was the general

opinion that the adoptive was the real father of Livia’s younger son. sar-
doine. (King.)

V. A. ΗΒΑ» or Onnes, crowned with urbest-ears, and veiled. The profile,
although fine, is obviously not ideal, showing this to be the porti-ait of some
princess, represented, by a turn of flattery of which the Egyptians set the
first example, as the goddess of Abundance. This head pasees, as is usual
with the type, for Livia’s, but as the face differs somewhat from her ascer-
tained porti-aits, it more probably represents some queen of the Ptolemaic or

Seleucidnn linesg and such attribution is supported by the very refined cha—
racter of in execution. Sard. (Blaene.)

V. Β. CAsron, wearing a felt petasus, the regular head-cerering of the
Thessalian horsemen. 'l'he loop on the apex will be noticed as occul-ring
similarly on the cap of the Etruscan charioteer, figured at p. 2. The sace
has allthe character in its boyish and beautiful features of a pertrait from the
lise, and, if really intended for one, may be reckoned amongst the earliest
attempta in that style anywhere to be discovered. This head is exactly iden-
tical with one (twice repeated, the only circumstance maz-king them out for the
Dioscuri), upon an Oscan painted vase, published in the “ Bun. del Inst. Arch.
Rom.'’ for the year 1865. rl¹his coincidence, which cannot fail to atrike any-
one who compares the two drawings, is of particular velue in the discrimina·-
tion between the Italiote and Etruscan genis, proving as it does that the
scarabei, whose designs evince great refinement of teste, are assignnble to the
