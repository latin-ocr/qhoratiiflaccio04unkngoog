456 DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIONS

terest of the subject, I know of no other ancient monument which gives so
mutate an idea of the very peculiar construction of the oelehrated barbir. m
This integ-lio has few rivnls in point of execution in early Greek nrt, all th ·
details being engraved with the most wonderful delioecy, even the seco ἢ.»
all the finish of a miniature. The elaborate eompleteness of the drap ry.
which entirely envelopes the person, marks ιι considerably earlier period in
the history of art than that to which the half-nude figure on the similar eub-
jeot already given, is to he referred. My drawing is only enlarged by om·-
quarter of the height, so as to give ita actual effect. the gem being of unum-l
sizo in its class, a soembeoid of rock-orystal formerly belonging to the Che-v.
Brondsted. (Cockerell.)

TITLE PAGE.

ORACE. This bust is mignod to our poet principalbv, it must be con-
fessed, on the strength of the initia! H, so signifimntly inserted in the
field. The attribution however is fairly supported by the bnyf-branch in
frent, a proof that the portmit represents a poet. The work of the imagit-
indioates a date by some century and a half later than Horace's own, aud
belongs to the times when he had beoome a ‘⁴ school-author.’' This hom-vor
does not invalidate its authenticity, as numerous busts and statues of the 1 m t
were then in existence, notably the one erected in the forum of his nww
town, Venusia. Yellow beryl. (Elaean.)

P. v. Minerva, wearing an Attio helmet embossed with a wingod hip-
pocampus. The work is not antique, but a very happy imitation, or ram-r
resuscitation, of the punest Greek style by that greatest of modern enam-
νεη, Regu. of Naples. On this aoeount 1 have thought it might justif be
admitted smongst the original masterpieees of the same art. Aquamurine.
(mag.)

P. xii. Achilles about to put on his armour. Sardonyx (Praun.)
