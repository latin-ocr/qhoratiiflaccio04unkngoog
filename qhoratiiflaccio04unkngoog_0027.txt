INTRODUCTION xvii

For Ι now come to the one memorable exception alluded to
above: I mean of course the eight verses prefixed in a few
MSS. to Satire 1 10: ‘ Lucili qusm sis mendosus—ut redeam
illuc '. One might compare them with the four lines which
in some books precede ‘ Arma virumque cano’. These eight
lines are omitted by the greater part of the better MSS. and
are unknown to the old scholiasts. External evidence is
therefore much against them3 and yet they are found in some
of our most ancient copies. The verses themselves were not, I
unhesitatin gly essert, and could not have been written by
Horace. Yet they are as old or almost as old as the satire
itself3 and were composed by some man of education, well·
acquainted with the matters in dispute‚ one who had formed
his style in an older school thau that of Horace or Virgil, and
yet was a convert to the modern style, one for instance' 1n the
position of Maecenas or Augustae. 'I'he peculiar cast of
these verses, and the fact that they have come down among
the works of Horace and yet could not have been generally
accepted as his, seem to me to speak volumes' m favour of the
essential genuineness of his werke, uniform in their manner
and found in all codices alike.

But why do I dwell on points so generally conceded in this
country i> Because in Germany a very different opinion widely
prevails among the most distinguished scholars who have
edited or criticised Horace. In 1859 the most eminent clas-
sical publisher in Germany issued a handsome volume of six
hundred pages written by Mr. Ο. F. Gruppe: it is called
⁶ Minos: upon the interpolatione in the Roman poete, espe-
cially Horace, Virgil and Ovid ’. Why it is called Minos, I
don’t know: Rhadamanthine it is in temper, if in nothing
else. More than half the book is given to prove that a large
portion of Horace's odes, among them some of the noblest, are
wholly or partly spurious: one of the wholly spurious is
111 29 Tyrrhena regum progenies. One would have believed
this book to be a sorry jest, if it were not too pointless for
that, and a reductio ad absurdum of the theory in question.
