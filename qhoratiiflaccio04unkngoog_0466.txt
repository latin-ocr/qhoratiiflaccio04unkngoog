422 DESCRIPTION OF [onas.

ωεστ-ἱρὴ of some noted and archaic work in bronze. Despite im stiffnees,
there is an inmte benuty in the figure that tells of the great masters who im-
mediately preceded Phidias. Winckelmnnu, in describing a pute from this
gem (P. G. de Stoech, p. 76), remarks upon its execution aa very beautifully
exemplifying the practice of the early school in enctly displnying the nude
figure through the closely-fitting drapery, ns in the present case, where the limbo
are plainly ohown through the parellel folds of their thiu envelope. Another
proof of the early date of the copy ineu· in supplied by the spelling of the
owner’u name, in which the H is aa yet not n vowel, but the mark of nepita-
tion. Ietronne takes him for the Oecan Heius, the friend nnd victim os
Verres, but the style of the work is anterior by severa-l generations to la‘s
date. The name Heius may be derived from Υημι, and bear the sense of
archer, since the similar form, “nam was an epithet of Apollo ς and, thia
granted, the benrer's motivo in selecting sor patronem the deity “ who delighoe
in arrom '⁹ (Dinn’n commonent Homeric title), becomes obvious enough.
Antique pute. (Blaene.)

XXIII. A. Sow, before her lies a wild epple. This animal was the special
sacrifice dedicated to Ceres, aa Ovid informo ue (Fut. i. 671) 2-

“ Placnntur matres frugum Tellurique Ceresque
Far-re auo gnvidae visceribusque mie.”

He gives for ren-son the very prosilio one of the mischief ewino do to the grow-
ing what, but other mythologistn saw in the selection of the victim an honour
pnid to the animal ns the first instructor of man in the art of ploughing, 1)] iu
practice of turning up the earth with its mont. If Herodotus is to be cre-
dited, owine were the only ploughmen known in Egypt aa late aa his own
times: being turned in upon the moint fields nster the fan of the ἱιιιιιιδιιείοιι,
they tmtnpled into the soil the seed-corn previously strewed over it by the
ownero. This connection of the εον with the goddess of the earth sufficiently
accounts for the fre-quency of ite appearance upon the fineet geme of Greek
and Etruscan timec. 'l'ho present figure, which is drawn and finished with
uncommon cure, provee that the ancients understood the points of a good pig
aa thoroughly aa does any Enoex faa-mer of our own day. Cdcedony scum-
beus. (Dr. Nott. Imp. Gom. Ι. 61.)

ΧΧΙΠ. n. Ius-munna or Sacnmcn: the praesericulunn flagon holding
the wine for libation, flanked by the necteris, axe, and secespita, knife sor
cutting up the victim. Above is shown the patera for receiving the wine
from the flagon, and out of which the libation was actually poured; whilst below
stands the victim itself. This combination of the insignia of the sacerdotal
office attente the gem to have been the signet of some high dignitary of the
order, which also may be infermd from the ext-reme beauty of ite workman-
ship. Amethyst. (Praun.)
