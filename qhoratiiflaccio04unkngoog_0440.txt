396 DESCRIPTION OF [onas.

lyre upon the head of a small female figure holding forth a branch of a trec.
This subsidiary personage has been explained as Pitho, or else Themis, the
original possessor of the Delphic shrine, but Visconti is certainly in the right by
considering her nothing more than one of the ὄλοφόροι, chorus of little girls who
annually bore the first-fruits os the country to their patron god. Sard. (King.)

XXII. A. J uns, Kme or Numnu, the last and the most sormidable to
Caesar of the friends of Pompey. His enormous periwig, with its rows of
elaborate curls, reads us an amusing comment upon Cicero’s jocose allusion to
his personal appearance during his visit ω Rome, some twenty years before
the date of this pertrait: “Volitat ante oculos istorum Juba, regis filius,
adolescens non minus bene nummatus quam bene capillatus ” (Pro Leg.
Agr. 22). He had been despatched to that city by his father, Hiempsal, to
buy a decree confirming him in the possession of the public land on the
Mauntanian coast, which he had unceremoniously appropriated. How-ever
profuse his locks may have been in his youth, it is probable those decorating
this likeness were artificia, a fashion remarked by Strabo as prevailing
amongst the Num'idians. 'l'hey doubtless had learnt it from their Carthaginien
neighbours‚ for Hannibal, in his bust figured by Visconti (Icon. Grec. ΙΙΙ.
Pl. 17). is unmistakably bewigged3 and Silius also leaves no doubt as to the
same practice amongst his countrymen,

‘⁶ Tunc frontem Chremes intonsam umbrante capillo
Saeptus et horrentes effingens crine galeros.”—(Pun. Ι. 405.)

But all the credit of the invention is due to the Pharaohs of remote-st an-
tiquity, who regularly paraded, on occasions of ceremony, in huge full-
bottomed wige, perfect specimens of which have come down to our times.

'Phe length of the African chief ’s purse, equally immortalised by Cicero with
that of his curls, is still attested to numismatists by the abundance of denarii
extant coined out of his treantes, with his image and superscription‚ for the
pay of the troops who, under Q. Scipio (Pompey's father-in-law) and
Petreius, played out their desperate gamo in his dominions. 'Phe notorious
arrogance of J uba, which, as Hirtius recorda, he made his Roman friends so
bitterly feel, was doubtless often, though unwillingly‚ propitiated by their
wearing ou their fingers the pertrait of himself in the character of their
patron, as the rule then was with other cliente of the powerful. This suppo-
sition affords a plausible explanation for the existence of these numerous
pertraits of a barbarian king whose sole historicnl importance is derived
from his ill-started connection with the fortunes of Pompey. This head is
engraved in the most finished manner of Roman art as it flourished in his
times, on a ‹lark Sard. (Maskelyne.)

XXII. n. Tan Ernuscsu, on Psnasmc, Hascunns, in the act of drawing
his bow. The peculiar form of the weapon explains clearly Homer’s epithet
ωαλίντονα τόξα 3 and also why Euripides makes the unlettered rustic com-
