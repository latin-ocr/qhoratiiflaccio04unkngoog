INTRODUCTION xxix

Let me touch concisely on a few more passages: Oarm. 1 1
13 Ι am unable to decide between ‘dimoveas' and ‘demoveas ’.
4 8 though Ι have retained the ordinary reading of edi-
tions here, Ι believe that MS. authority properly interpreted
indicates that Horace wrote not ‘zm-it but uissit (i.e. visit, as
Bentley and before him Rutgersius read) ι the MSS. of Plotius,
who quotes this passage in his book de metris, appear to have
wit or assit ,· clearly therefore he did not find in his Horace
urit, and he is of course a much older authority than any ex-
isting MS. : the old Bernese fails us in this ode, nor do the
scholiasts either of them quote or eitplain this verse. Several
of the oldest of Keller’s Paris MSS. have nisit ‚- one of the
oldest Swiss and one of the oldest Paris MSS. have writ
written on an erasure, that is some older reading. Oddly
enough a Bodleian MS. cited by Bentley has uissit. It seems
to me then more than probable that Horace wrote amit, a com-
mon way of spelling visit in his day: comp. the well known
passage in Quintilian 1 7 20 ‘ quid quod Ciceronis temporibus
paulumque infra, fere quotiens s littera media vocalium longa-
rum vel subiecta longis esset, geminabatur? ut cumeae cassus
divissiones τ quomodo et ipsum et Vergilium quoque scripsisse
manus eorum docent ἐ and to illustrate this we find in in-
scriptions of that date causa and caussa side by side over and

over again. Ribbeck’s proleg. p. 445 will shew how often
Virgil’s MSS. especially P, the best on this head, retain
traces of the ss .· thus among 50 other cases we find in geor. 1
167 provisas, and, a very suggestive instance for us, Aen. v
637 imao„ i. e. aissa, for visa. By Quintilian's time the usage
in this as in most other points of orthography had settled

itself, and we find only visus, misit, but missus, though chance
might have ruled it missit and misus : comp. the next words of

Quintilian ‘ atqui paulum superiores etiam illud quod nos
gemina dicimus mai, una dixerunt '. When therefore adesit be-
came obsolete, some traditions rightly kept uisit,· others altered
the unknown form to iussit or ussit,- and then the unmean-
ing perfect was changed to wn't. N one of the passages quoted
