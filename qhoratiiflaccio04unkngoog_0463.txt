female divinities combined. 'l'he only example previously known to me of
this peculiar- union of sunken and relieved work is a bust of Antinous as
Bacchus inclosed in a frasne os Dionysaic figures. Agna-onyx. (Blacas.)

XV . Hnmrnaontrtm, in the guise of a Hand, mahing forwards in
Bacchic fremy, and unrobing himself, aster the usual and typical mode of such
representations. A work in the most finished Greek style. (Berlin.)

XVI. A. Pansam, the 'last of the Macedonian kings, disguised in the
winged petasus of his sabulous namesake, which ie tipped with an eagle’s
head, to intimate that the hero was the son of Jove. On his shoulder rests
the Ιιαφὲ, hooked falchion, given to the Perseus of old by Mei-cury, when sent
to deotroy Medusa. 'l'he mean and crasty character of the unlucky prince ia
plainly stamped upon his physiognomy, despite this assumption of heroic
costume. This gem is of great historic interest, there being good reason to
believe it engraved sor the king’s own signet, being in the sapphincs, lapis-
lazuli, a stone tex-med &ausast from such employment. (Blacas.)

XVI. n. Gmm or wana-r, with two ants for supportem, to use the
heraldic term. This ineect was assigned to Ceres as her special attribute,
because by its own practice it first taught mankind how to storo up corn in gra-
nai-ies, which, like the ant’s, were always subterraneous in ancient timeo, as
the silos of the Kabyles continue, anchanged, to the present day. The legend
PH in the field denotes the original owner of the signet, one Pius, doubtless
some patrician agriculturist, who has ao cleverly formed a pretty device out
of such very unpromiaing componente. Sard. (Vollard. Imp. Gem. II. 92.)

XVII. Hnan, in the most archaic manner, like those of the Roman
kings, copied from the Etruscan statues in the Capitol, put upon certain con-
sular coins. ΤΚΒ is one of the very rare attempta at portraiture to be found
upon a scarabeus. The flllet round the hair distinguishea it for the head of a
prince‚ some Etruscan Lucumo, or primitive ltaliote tyrannus. “The an·
tique Iamasl' if depicted at all, must bave appeared thus in his imago. It
is impooeible to assign a meaning to tbe letters Ε Ε. Green jasper.

(Bm.)

xvm. A. Faunae, reclining, half-intoxicated3 in his band the cantharus,
at his side the capacious crater, whence it was replenished. It will be observed
that the demi-god is depicted here, as in all archaic art, entirely human, with
only the ears, mil, and feet of a goat. It ia only in Roman art that Pan ap-
pears with half his body caprine; at the same period a distinction was made in
