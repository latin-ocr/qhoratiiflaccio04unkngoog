viii PREFAOE

warmest patron of gem-engravers. Horace, doubtless‚ had
osten been called upon to admire each fresh addition to the
cabinet of his Etruscan benefactor, and discussed with him
its beauties as they reclined ‘ sub arta vite ' at his Sabine
farm, whilst the invalid statesman ‘ smoothed his care—worn
brow ' in cheerful converse with the bard. Perhaps the
latter caught from such a sight many a bright and joyous
thought now enshrined in his verse3 nay more, the unfading
imm01tality of these vehicles of art tempta one to indulge
the pleasing illusion, truly an ‘ amabilis insania‚’ that
among-st the numerous intagli decorating these pages, some
one or two may actually have charmed the eye and stimu-
lated the imagination of the tasteful poet.

The main principle directing my choice amongst the im-

kind assistance of many eminent amateurs (whom I now
thank for their essential services in furthering my object)
has been to consult the interests of archaeology no less than
those of fancy and the muse. With this view historic por-
traits and memoriale of important events were the primary
object of my researcheS, and have been introduced as exten-

of the art supplying my materiale, by far the larg-er part fall
within the province of mythology, a branch of classical study
on which, if critically examined‚ they throw the clearest light..
It has therefore been my endeavour to make the most of their
assistance in this particular by the largest possible variety 111

ferent types that set forth the same religious idea in the vari-
ous phases of its development. For this purpose my collection
will offer the gods and heroes of Greece and Italy, imaged
forth in every successive style from the solemn grotesqueness
of Pela-egio and Etruscan art (whence much has here been
drawn, it being a rich mine as yet almost unexplored for such
