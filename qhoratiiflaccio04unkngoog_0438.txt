394 DESCRIPTION OF [onus.

although it is impossible to point out the particular one to which that honour
belongs. The last. of the great masters in the nrt of chasing siber, Teucer.
flouriahed under Pompey, and everything tende to prove that their meta}

relievi were faithfuny repmduoed in the camei that took their place in the
following generation. Late Greek work. Yellow and blue onyx. (Beverley.)

XVI. A. A Funis, in the exercito of her office of pursuing the guilty.
Under such a form as this must AEochylus have brought the sister-arengerii
upon the Attio stage, when their hon-ilic aspect struck the spectatore dead with
fright. This also ia the original type of the Gorgon 3 being, in fact, the
Hindoo Rhamioi, very slightly modified aa yet by Grecian uste. No signet
could be better suited to soal up tremore, and threaten death to the brenker
of the fastening, than such n device—doubtleas the purpose for which this often
served, aa it comes from Kertch, the emporium of the primitive Greek gold-
scekers. 'l'hc type ia cognate to the locelity, the Rhipaea Mountaina (Ur-al)
being accounted the native haunt of the Gorgone. Snrd scorbeoid. (St.
Petersburgh.)

XVI. n. Pacui-unus commum-mo mn anwomt or Mu: a very un-
common version of the subject, inasmuch as ancient nrt usually represents
him as engaged in giving the finishing touchee to the clay he has moulded
into the human form. The work of the present inttglio, although but
mediocre, has an the appearance of being antique Βοωιυ, and probably belong·
ω the commencemcnt of the Decadence. San-d. (Blae-s.)

XVII. A. Hm or PAR, crowned with vine-leaves. Faunus was the Pan of
Italy (being probably no more than the Etruscan rendering of the Greek word),
at least in Horaoe’s idea, as plainly appears from the poet’s here alluding to
Lycaeum in Arcady aa his proper habitation. Few reprenentations of the
sylvan deity are such expressive embodiments of his received character, or eo
nobly executed as the eard here figured. (Dr. N ott, Imp. Gem. IV. 65.)

XVII. Β. Smmmm) Am> Nrurn (who may well represent Horace and
Tyndaris), reclining on a lion’s hide spread out under a tree‚ and liztening ω
the “ eweet pipe ” of Faunus or Pan. The youth is singing, the nymph beat-
ing time with her hands to the music. On the flat rock eerving sor table is
set a crater, containing the “ innocentis pocula Lesbii‚” which the pdr hul
been quaffing to allay the heat of the buming dog-days. Cuneo, slightly en-
lzrged. (Beverley.)

XVIII. A. Tun Innm« ΒΑεσιιυε, bear-ded, of grave and reverend aspect,
clad in the croc-ota long yellow gown appropriated to this deity, and still the
prescribed garb of the Buddhist banze, and bearing the thyrsus bound with
finees, nn well aa his proper vase, the cantharas. This is the original type
