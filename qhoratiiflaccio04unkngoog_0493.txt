avenger was represented by this type, as the legend on the medals bearing it
informs the world. At his side is a leyionary standard, planted in the ground,
in order to leave no doubt as to his nationality. After the destruction of
Brutus and Cassius, Augustus built a temple to Mars underthis title, in token
of gratitudo for the vengeance taken by his aid upon the murderers of his
adoptive father. Very flue work os the Augustan age. (Berlin.)

IV. Errcvaus3 a life-like pertrait engraved in the best Roman style.
Heads of this philosopher are extremely rnre on geme ς a thing difficult to
account for, aa Cicero (De Fin. Ι. v.) laugha at the fondness of his sect for
carrying about their Master’ s likeness in their rings, and considering the
popularity of his doctrines at Rome, one would naturally have expected his
head to present itself in our cabinets at least as frequently aa that of
Socrates.

V. Δ. Manctm carrying round, at the feast of the gods, the bowl of am-
brosia, or immortalicy (the umecta-cup of Hindoo mythology), ⁸its nature
being expressed by the Psyche-butterfly perched on the brim. Such a pic-
ture as this, extremely unfrequent in ancient art, must have suggested to
Sappho the two lines preserved by Asthenoeus (x. 436): “ 'I'he crater of am-
brosia was mixed, and Hermes bearing round the alpis served the wine out
to the gods.’' This gem, therefore, enables us to identify the hitherto un-
certain figure of the latter vessel. In the early mytholog-y of Sappho's times,
Hermes held the post of cup-bearer in Olympus, in virtue of his office as ιιῧρυξ to
the gods, the two occupatione going together in every regal household, aa may
be seen from Homer's account of feasts. It was much later that the progress of
luxury appropriated Ganymedes to such an occupatiori. 'I'his intaglio is done
in the perfect Greek style, but to all appearance copied from an early bronze.

V. Β. Van, with a pair of pig-eona perched upon the handles. It would
seem that the designer of this intaglio has endeavoured to embody in its
ligure his own notion of the much-disputed nature of N estor’s celebrated bowl.

vl. A. Seruaeum Usu, springing from a lotus-flower3 an emblem pro—
bably engaging the protectiones Isis for the deceased. Its handles are en-
tvrined with a finet, a customary offer-ing to the manee. It would be hardly
possible to discover, in the whole range of art, a more graeeful design sor this
species of vessel.

VI. s. Num, a portrait identical with that put upon a denarius coined for
Pompey by his quaestor Calpurnius Piso, who appears to have claimed descent
from the 'ancient legislator for Horace (Δ. r. 292), addresses his sons as
“ Pompilius sanguis.’' Both pertraits must therefore have been copied, about
the same time, from the statue of Numa in the Capitol, still existing when

Pliny wrote (xxxiii 4). 'l'he style of this head is pure Etrusca exactly
