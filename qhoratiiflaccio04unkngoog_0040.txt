to support this use of it, least of all the Greek φλέγει, which
= accendit, seems at all applicable3 but Venus dancing in
the moonshine‚ while her husband is away visiting the stithies
of the Cyclops, is a beautiful picture. 1 7 27 Ι leave 6 aus-
pice Teucro ’ of most MSS: the old Bornese fails us here:
though ‘ auspice Teucri ' of many MSS. seems certainly to have
been read by the Acron scholiast: Bentley’s ‘ Phoebo ’‚ accepted
by many, is also specious. 20 10 Pwm for Tu is not I
think necessary. 26 9 Pimplea for Pimplea· can hardly
be right. 11 2 2 Lambinus' ‘ Abditae ' would render
this obscure stanza somewhat less dark. 13 23 though Ι

read ‘ discriptas ’, which has far higher authority 011 its side ε

think been most successfully supported by Maoleane against
Peerlkamp’s 6 Maior an illa ', accepted by Orelli and Haupt:
he cites an exact parallel from Cic. ad Q. fintr. 1 1 13
‘ maioraque praeferant fasces illi 00 secures dignitatis insignia
quam potestatis ἐ the way in which Latin writers sometimes
