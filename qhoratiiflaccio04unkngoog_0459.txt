ampton. Imp. Gom. ΙΙ. 69.)

V. n. Pon-run· or A Wsnmon, his hair tied with a fillet, and covered with
the visored Corinthiun helmet. This defence is elevated upon the head, in
the way it was worn when not actually in the combnt. 'I'he Etruscan border
inclosing the design proves the work to be of either Tyrrheno or ltaliote
origin. It may be Mars, else is undoubtedly one of the earliest attempta at
portraiture in a gem nnywbere to be discovered. It is finished in all the
details with the most scrupulous minuteness. Surd. (Blucas.)

VI. Insmsu or *run sAcnnnoux. omen, very artisticnlly combined. In
the centre is the buter-mnium, wreathed with the vitta used sor decomting the

VII. Β. Pmmmrn, seuted in u pensive attitude, and garing on the bow of
the absent Ulysses, which stands against the wall before her. 'I'he figure tells
its story well, though represented with au the nai'vetc‘ of archaic art, without
the least feeling of beauty or sentiment. The work is nevertheless of ex-
treme interesn as being the very earliest instance of ι subject unmistakebly
