the boyich figure by later nrt, which saw nothing deeper in the character than
the Genius of mei-timent and festivity. So completely had the ancient con-
ception of the type become obsolete, that Pausaniae remarks, aa specinlly
worthy of notice amongst the decoratione of the Ooffer of Cypselus, that the
Dionysos “had a beau-d, and was clothed in a long tunic reaching to hie
heele.” 'l'he same change in the idea makes it more than prohable that of
euch a chnpe aa· appetu-e upon this gem wne the very ancient statue cnr-ved out of
a single gigantie vene-noch ceen by Pliny nt Populonia, and passing then for
a Jupiter. But the choice of the peculim· material, and the locelity Popu-
lonia (Poplunn on its coine), being named after Puplum, the Etruscan
Dionysos, almost demonstrate the true character of the image (doubtlecs long
before robbed of hic distinctive golden cantharas), that had become one of
the natural curiositiee of the deenyed Tyrrhenian city. (H. N. XIV. 2.)

XVIII. n. Baccmnu, totally ovet-come by the influence of the god, siuk-
ing buckwards and veinly endeavouring to stay herself by gracping at a 1²11
amphora of mont elegant form, whilst her thymus end gnrlend drop from her
relnxing hold. Of all such figures, this may be pronounced the finect for

XX. Mum Smmx, here representing (ne the editors of the Imp. Gem.
explain it) Dionyson Leontomorphoe‚ proffering with one hand a lily which
assumes the form of a capacious crater, whilnt in the other he holds a myrtle-
bmnch: a type conveying in the moet speaking manner nn invitation to con-
viviality. Executed with wonderful precieion of drawing and equnl delicacy
of touch, in a eomewhat early Greek style. San-d. (Mai-quis de Sallues.

XXI. Α. Duum, holding in one hand n bow, in the other a distaff. 'l'he sun
and moon ovet-head are the primitive symbols, bon-owed from Amynan art,
that denote eternity, end point out the presence of a deity in the figure repre-
sented. At her feet are seen her attributes, the stag and bound. Thia has
