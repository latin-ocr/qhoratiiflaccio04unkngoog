408 DESCRIPTION OF [onze.

quite unique, but may be iuterpreted aa symbolizing the union of force with
promptitudo, by a novel creation of the eume nature as the winged lion, the
regular attribute of N ergal. the Assyriun war-god. The Greeks, in truth.
derived cll cuch symbolic moneters indirectly through the medium of the
Ionicus, from the inventione of Assyriam funem ac is evinced, most plainly of
all, in the rice and [ηοω-εει os their nse painting. 'ro thie source of ancient
art Pliny alludee by his brief notice of the first division of pointing into the
Asiatic and Heilsdic schoola. This elegant und novel animal is eng-rared in
a style of incomparuble delio-cy upon an agate of several bright colours,
arranged so aa to form a. true heraldic chevron. This singular natural con-
sonnation of the stone was, there is reason to believe, much admirer! by the
early Greeks, for they have made it the vehicle for several of their best
intagii. But, from come now inscrutnble metire, such engrcvinge represent
animal forms exclusively, homes, centaurii, and the like, which are arranged
with a very conspicuous co-ordinance to the chevron emblamned by nature on
the sig-net. In the present instance, the artist hae eo ingeniously managed
laic deeign, that the lionecs appears bounding forth out of the dark chade
into the clear and colom-lese field of the agate. (Beverley.)

lx. A. 'l'nn Dnsmu or Corin, who, sected on the ground, is beniling hic
Psyche, the dead butterfly which liee before him. Hardly another antique
work cun be found co full os grace, and telling its story co plainly, aa does thie
exquisite little gem. From the unusually definite form of the ground-line,
which hus the appearance of a atone plinth, it may be infert-ed that the

subject is a copy from c marble sculpture. Onyx. (Dr. Nott. Imp. Gem. IV.
32.)

lx, ιι. SAcmricu Arrun Α Via-rom, in which the chief personage, to judge
from the Venus emblazoned ou his ahiem, repreeeute AEnecs. The execution
of this beautiful intaglio seems tc indicate a copy by cn excellent modern
hand from cn antique original. Sardoine. (Blaene.)

X. Melicum, with his wcnd and money-bag, accompenied by Fortuue
standing on her globe. This ie the earliest representation of the goddess (so
popular under the Empire) that has come in my way, being done in the
elaborate archuic Greek manner, whereas cll the rest display the Roman tacte
end trecanent. N evertheleoe, the Atheniens had the type of this deity from
the first, which appears amongct the rect from the anecdote Plutarch tells of
the satirica! picture published by the enemiee of Timotheus, representing

that general asleep whilst Fortune was catching citien for him in her net.
Sard. (Beverley.)

XI. A. VuncAn, forging abelmet, part of the armo of AEnecs, as may be in-
ferred from the presence of Venus, who holds the finished mord, and appears
a· if hustening on the work. Roman. (Berlin.)
