INTRODUOTION xxvii

in the satir-083 and some of the later poets ventured on pc‘ila-
tia and Vaticanum. But to shorten 611 essentially long Italian
syllable like.the a of Apulia or Affenninus would be porten-
tous in classical times. One might explain the corruption in
two ways: either Apuliae was 6 marginal gloss, and, as so
osten happens, 1166 supplanted the word it was meant to ex-
plain, 66 for instance ‘ limina Dauniae ’ which Ritter and
others have adopted: or else the copyist's eye was caught by
the Apulo of the preceding verse, and he wrote down Apuliae
for some other feminine ending in iae or ae .· Bentley suggests
‘ Nutricis (or, Altricis) extra limina sedulae'. Mr. Yonge
and, quite independently of him, one in whose judgment and
taste Ι have the greatest confidence, have proposed ‘ limina
villula-e ’. To this I feel the following objection: dirninutive8‚
used to such excess in the language of the people, in the
comic poets, in Catullus and others, almost disappeared from
the higher poetry of the Augustam and later ages: most of 611
perhaps in the Aeneid and similar poems„'a.nd next to them in
the odes of Horace. 'I'hough puero, had vanished from the
language, Virgil may be said in the Aeneid to have rejected
puella, 66 it occurs only twice in the 661116 conventional phrase
⁴ pueri innuptaeque puellae ’, horrowed probably from 611 older
poet: mamm is found in the eclogues; but villa never ap-
pears in the Aeneid. Now though Horace in hie odes does
use villa and osten puella, Ι would not venture to introduce
on mere conjecture the double diminutive villula, any more
than puellasla or ceolhelm or the like. It is said he 1166 povr-
mula .- but the motive of that ode is 6 sportive sels-abase·
ment, and ‘ my poor shield ’ 1166 its point. Again, though that
might be used to defend wama, if found in 611 the MSS„ it
6611 ‘hardly justify its introduction on mere conjecture.

In connexion with the above I will now speak of another
puzzling' passage: 111 24 3 ‘ caementis licet occupes Tyrrhe·
num omne tuis et mare Apulicum ’ or ‘ Ponticum ' or ‘ publi-
cum ’ of MSS. If Apuliowm, which is scarcely latin, be
older than the other words, then it too may be 6 marginal
