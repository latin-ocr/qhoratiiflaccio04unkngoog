reasons have induced me to employ this series as largely as
possible—its great variety in subjects that in so many
instances exactly met my requirements ; and the genuine anti-
quity of the works themselves, stamped as it is with the
warranty of the best judges upon that point anywhere to be
found. The circumstance, also, that many of the originale
have in the interval since their first publication come into the
possession of English amateurs, owing to the sale in London of
the cabinets then containing them (as notably that of Dr. Notat),

country, obligingly communicated to me, have, upon investi-
gation, been found to yield much that was valuable for my
purpose, and to be furnished by them alone. But I cannot
conclude this account of the principles of my plan, and of the
sources for carrying it out, without gratefully acknowledging
how materially my work has been forwarded by the assistance
