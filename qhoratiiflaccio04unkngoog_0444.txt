400 DESCRIPTION OF [onze.

XXIX. s. Ganyme bearing the emblems of his former and present occu-
pation, the shepherd’s crook and the nse of nectar. This, the Roman mode
of treating the subject, strongly contrasts with the very materialistic concep-
tion οἰ the same personage in Etruscan art, given st p. 62. (Berlin.)

XXX. Α. Vnus, in her character of “Euploesss’ the protectress of ma·
rinerg, borne over the ocean upon a hippocampus. The goddess wem-s s
magnificent necklsce to deelare her quality (that being the distinctiva orna-
ment of the Queen of Beauty), and expands her peplun with one hand to
catch the favour-ing breeze and assist the progr-ess of her steed, who bests the
waters with the flns of s fisi), not the fore-legs of s horse, ss in the way this
animal is usually depictod. In the present csse his figure is copied more
closely from nature, the type being the curious fish hippocampus of the Me-
diterranean. Amongst the innumerable representations of Venus on gems, 1

know of none compar-able for elegance to this. Sard. (Duc de Luynes.)

XXX. n. Crem exerting all his strength to bold up an enormous cornu-
copia‚ the popular emblem of riches: s most appropriate device sor a nymph
of Glycers's profession. 'l'he name “Aulus’' in the field, signature of sn
imaginary srtist, is a modern interpolation. Yellow mleedony. (Marlborough.)

XXXI. A. Arotno Dnnrmcus: on one side stands the altar supporting his
tripod‚ surmounted by a blazing sun, attribute of the god ss Phoebus, and by a
twittering bird, allusive to bis character ss muster of auqury. On the other
side lie his bow and quii-er, upon which sits the god’s own prophetie ominous
fowl, the raven. 'Phe inscription in the field shows the gem to come out of
the original cabinet of Lorenzo dei Medici. The stone has been eut down
into an octsgon in mediaeval times, when that pat-tem was greatly in rogue
for signets in consequence of its supposed talismanie virtues, ss representing
the oydoad of Pythagoras. Sard. (Florence.)

XXXI. n. Aronno Annuus, guardian of rosds and streets, leaning against
s dwarf column, his proper symbol in this character (Chrishns’s lat), snd hold-

· ing forth his bow¹ in token of amity. Piredot.. (King.)

XXXII. Α. Aronno Musmmm, clad in the long gown of a Muse‚ snd
sested before the Delphie tripod‚ singing to the notes of his own cithara.
The make of that instrument, the invention of this god, ss distinguished from
the lyra of Mercury, is very clearly expressed in this representation. An ex-
ample, almost without a rival, of the perfect Greek style. Sard. (Dr. Nou,

Imp. Gem. IV. 21.)

XXXII. n. Tsnrsmuonn ‘rusum usn Lru, the attitude migned to this
muse by the regulations of ancient art ; ss Ausonias expresses the code,—

“ Terpsichore affectus citharis movet, imperat, auget.”
