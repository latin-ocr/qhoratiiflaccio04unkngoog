Her figure is backed by s. losty pedestal supporting a statuette of Bacchus,
presiding deity of the theatre. The name in the field is that of the pretended
ortist Allien, whose existence is due to the fabricatore of signatures in the last

century. Onyx of three strata, (Blacss.)

a sphinx ond a mortsl horse, and confi-onted by ahsrpy, who amicsbly proffers
him a lotus-flower. A design rich in symbolism, and breathing au the gloomy
mysticism ofthst Orientel creed, as yet uninfluenced by the elegant materialism
of Hellenic culture. 'l'he horpy, that regular „emblem of Desth in archaic
sculpture, may, however, by her presence here giveaclue to the hidden mesn-
ing of this composition. The horse, also, in sepulchral bas-reliefs, signifies
departure from this world, whilst the sphinx is the attribute of the Assyrian
war-god, Nes-gal. It may, therefore, be conjectured that this combination
pictur-es the happy arrival of some departed hero in the Elysian Fields, and
his welcome by the genius of the place whitber he is conreyed by the ministers
of his petron 'gods. In the well-known tomb-pninting st Tarquinii, the
deputed soul is borne along· on s car drawn by bis good and evil genii. And
the idea perhaps supplies the true interpretation of the interesting yraffito
here figured. Some such monument of primitive nrt probably suggested to
our poet the strange allusion to the deification of Romulus,—

“ Martis equis Acheronta fugit.''

XXXIV. J umen m ms Qummm, thundering above the clouds. The
hon-ses, in various attitudes, are drawn with uncommon spirit, and sreengrsved
with s lightness of touch that declares the work to proceed from some good
Grecian hand. Sord. (Pi-aun.)

XXXV. A. Tun Fon-runs Fortia, on Equaetm os· Amnis. She is figured
on this gem exnctly ns she appears, side by side with her twin-sister Fortuna
Felix (whose head is disdemed), upon a denarius coined by Q. Rustius5 a
master of the mint to Augustus. 'l'he symbol of the ram's heads alludes to
the cautiny device of the yens Rustis, s ram pascant, which was put on the

consular coinage of that family. The only differ-once between the two types
is, that on the denarius first mentioned the goddess holds in her hand the

same little disk (a libum, sacrificial calte?) which on the gem is seen in the bill
of the bird, and the exact meaning of which it is impossible to discover. She
appears bending her head forwords, ss though nodding essent to the questions
of those who come to consult ber far-samed crocle, that being the mode in

which her responses were returned there, as we learn from Macrobius (Sat.
