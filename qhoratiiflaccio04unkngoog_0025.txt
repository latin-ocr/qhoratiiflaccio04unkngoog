so immensely benefited. Since Bentley all or almost all the
most sagacious scholare have looked upon what Cruquius
names his ‘ antiquissimus Blandinius ' as by far the most
preoious recorded manuscript of the author 3 and with them
Ι entirely concur. No one I believe now doubts the essential
good saith 01· Oruquius; but in his days the art 01· 00116151011
was ill understood, and we are 0111611 left in total ignorance,
osten in doubt as to what his manuscripts really contained.
The ‘ antiquissimus ’ is much more unerring in the satires and
epistles than in the odes: 111 the latter its readings seem often
to be interpolated, though on the whole superior to those of
any other codex. Yet so far as I am able to judge there are
many passages, generally involving however but a single word
or so, where it would be impossible to say whether it has the
true or the false reading, unless we had some higher authority
able to control and oven-ule both it and all our other existing
authorities.

For English readers I need scarcely say that, with one me-

There is not a tittle 01· outward evidence for such a supposi-

Horace for a man of his powers I look upon as a very un-
equal writer, and many of his poems Ι do not rate very highly.
But his style throughout is his· own, borrowed from none who
preceded him, successfully imitated by none who came after
him. 'I'he Virgilian heroic was appropriated by subsequent
generations of pects, and adapted to their purposes with sig-
nal success: the hendecasyllable and scazon of Catullus be-
came part and parcel 01· the poetical heritage of Rome3 and
Μαι-11161 employs them only less happily than their matchless
creator. But the moulds in which Horace cast his lyrical and
his satirical thoughts, were broken at his death. The style
neither 01· Persius nor 01· Juvenal has the saintest resemblance
to that of their common master: Statius whose hendecasyl-
