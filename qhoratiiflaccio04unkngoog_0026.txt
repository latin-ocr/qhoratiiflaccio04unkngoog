xvi INTRODUOTION

lables are passable enough, has given us one alcaic and one
sapphic ode, which recal the bald and constrained efforts of a
modern schoolboy. I am sure he could not have written any
two consecutive stanzas of Horace3 and, if he could not, who
could Ρ And then to suppose that forgeries of whole poems
or portione of poems should have taken place, end yet lest no
truce of the fact behind them, during· ages when he was in
every public and private library! For that they certainly
must have had their origin at an early period, say before the
time of Quintilian, is admitted I believe by all judicious sd-
vocates of such forgeries: to give them a later date would
lead to endless contradictione and absurdities.

That the custom of fathering spurious werke on famous
writers was prevalent in those days is notorious enough. All
know the minor poems attributed to Virgil. Now whatever
others may think, I hold it to be a. demonstrable truth, though
this is not the place to enlarge upon it, that Vix-gil, to take
one sample of them, never wrote any Culex whatever3 that
the Culex we now have was forged little if at all later
than the time when the Aeneid was publishod, by some one
who wished to adorn with a Batrachomyomachie. the apothe-
osis of the Italian Homer3 and that this is the very poem
which was accepted as Virgil's by Lucan when he exclaimed
‘ et quantum mihi restat ad culicem ’; by Statius when iu
the preface to his Silvae he writes ‘ sed et culicem leg-imus
et batrachomyomachiam agnoscimus, nec quisquam est illus-
trium poetarum qui non aliquid operibus suis stilo remissiore
proluserit ' (a good commentas-y on the causes of its origin);
by Martial, Suetonius, and others. And so Suetonius speaks
of having had in his hands elegies and letters attributed to
Horace, but in his opinion spurious. Surely however for-
geries like these, common in modern as in ancient timeS, lend
no support to the theory that long spurious passages could
have been introduced among the genuine works of Horace
and Virgil during the only ages in which those forgeries
could possibly have been composed.
