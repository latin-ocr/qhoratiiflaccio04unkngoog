figure for its waves. 'l'he Etruscan explanatory legend certainly does not give
the name ofIcarus, but rather seems intended for Iphicle-9. If this be so, the
mistake curicusly betrays the artist’s shallow knowledge of Greek fablein his
thus confounding the son of Daedalus with the brother cf Hercules. But the
ressonis obvious enough. 'l'he name of the latter was necessarily familiar to
the 'Pyrrhenian from his connection with the national deity whose exploits
supplied the most prolific theme of all to primitive Glyptic art. Scarabeus.
(Duc de Luynes.)

11. n. Rom scama, a bull and a couple of goats testing under a tree to
escape the noonday sun. This composition, though simple in the extreme,
has nevertheless a very pleasing effect, and gives an accurate idea of the
character of ancient landscape-painting, which would have been composed
according to the same rules. The work is of the later Greek period. Sard,
found at Athens. (Mei-lin.)

111. A. Tun· Musa Mnnrounnn, or it may be anavA, as the patroness of
dramatis genius, holding in her hand the mask of the Bearded Bacchus (the god
in whose honour the primitive drama was invented), which she appears tc be
apostrophising. The meaning of the subject is rendered yet more plain by the
introduction of the blazing thymele or altar regularly placed in front of the
stage, and which was always of the cylindrical form represented here. 'l'ho
goddess is seated on a pile of arms, and beers a palm-branch, to declar-e the
peaceful times, befit-ting the celebration of scenic performanccs. Sard.

(King.)

ΙΙΙ. n. Panum, looking back3 of early Etruscan work. A bird, sorudely
indicated that its species cannot be ascertained, is perched on her shoulder3
on one side is her owl, on the other a third bird, certainly intended for a pea-
cock. The last is a very curious addition, and serves to give a clue tc the date
of this work, the style of which apparently bespeaks the highest antiquity.
Antiphon, who ssourished in the fifth century before our era is quoted by
Athenaeus (ix. 397), as describing pescocks first kept at Athens by his'con-
temporary‚ the noted Demos, son of Pyilampes, when the novelty excited
so much interest as to drsw crowds cf people to see them from Boeotia, and
even Thessaly. It. is, however, possible that the Etruscam may have known
the Indian bird before the Athenians, in consequence of their close alliancs
with those Phoenician tradere who, five centuries farther back, had imported
pescocks and apes to adorn the gardens of King Solomon. At Minerva's feet
is seen her accustomed serpent: she being in her origin the moon-goddess (as
Aristotle gives the old tradition), this nocturnal reptile with the moon-eyed
owl, became her natural attributes. But Demosthenes once, when disgusted
with the fickleness of his countrymen, humorously expressed his wonder that
the goddess of wisdom “should have chosen for pets such disgusting things
