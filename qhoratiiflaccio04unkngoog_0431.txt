AEGENAS, for whose contemporary pertrait this very characteristic head

is now universslly received, although I fear on no stronger grounds than its
frequent repetition by the best engravers of the Aug-ustum period. It is, indeed,
almost a logical conclusion, thst so enthusiastic an amateur in geme us Maecenas
is recorded to have been, could not have neglected this, at the time, so sashionsble
mode of perpetusting his memory3 and this particular portrait, whenever it
occurs, has obviously been executed with the same care and skill as the finest
heeds of the imperial family—a testimony to the importunes of the personage
represented, who, therefore, may reasonably be supposed the alter eqo of
Augustus. Behind the head may be discerned 'Alocxorpmon in letters
almost effaced by the injudicious repolishing to which the gem has been sub-
jected‚ and which, therefore, could not be shown in the woodcut. This name
posses, of course, for the signature of the celebrated eng-rever to Augustus, re·-
corded hy Pliny; but from the extreme popularity of the appellation amongst
the Greeks of that age, there is every probability it only designated the owner
of the signet, who thus proclsimed himself the client of the great man repre-
sented upon it. This intaglio has been long known-2 ss early as 1605 it was
shown by Bagsrris to the eminent antiquary Peiresc. It eume into the French
cabinet on the purchase of Lsuthier’s (including the geme of Begarris), by
Inuis XIV. Amethyst. (Paris.)

I. s. Ersuscss Omm'rsss driving a pair of winged horses: it will be
observed he wears a petasus exsctly similar to that of Castor upon the Blaesis
scarabeus represented further on, p. 166. The Etruscans verens fond of chariot-
races as the Greeks themselves. Plutarch (Poplicola) has preserved a. strange
legend illustrative of this. When the Veiens refused to give up the ominous
terra-cotta quadriga, made by their fictor, Volca, for the pediment of the new·-
built Capitol, a. four-horse car during the celebration of the races at. Veii ran
away, nor could be stopped before it reached the Forum of Rome. And, st
the time Herodotus wrote, the people of Agylla, (Cere) still propitisted by
annual chariot-races the mane-5 of the murdered Phocaeans of Corsica. Gold
qraffi'to. (Soc. candelari, Imp. Gem. 1. 59.)
