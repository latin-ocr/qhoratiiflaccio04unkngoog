base of the verse. I am disposed therefore to think that
Horace has here followed the same mle, to which he was
perhaps led by the ‚Greek word Rimas following. Similarly
in 111 5 17 ‘ Si non periret inmiserabilis ’ no specious correc-
tion has been made: in this place Alcaeus and the Greeks
could use at discretion a short syllable3 and Horace for once

has perhaps imitated them in this. Thus Catullus three
times has a trochee for the second foot of a sapphic. Owing
to these metrical difficulties some distinguished scholars have
pronounced these odes or part of them to be forgerieS. I
cannot too strongly express my dissent from this: any one
after Horace who could have written themg would have been
certain to observe the strictest rules of metre and prosody.
Carm. 11 20 13 Horace did not write ‘ Daedaleo ocior ': the
old Bernese and other high authorities have notior, which if a
gloss suits the sense and context admirably, far better than
tut-ior, wadaoior or any other conjecture. Very perplexing is
111 14 11 where the same Bernese and many good MSS. and
some scholia have ‘ male nominatis ': it reads like a very an-
cient metrical correction ; but the conjecture ‘male inominatis ’
Ι do not like, and ‘ male ominatis’ of the ‘antiq. Blandinius'
cannot be right3 any more than in Aen. ΧΠ 648 ‘ Sancta ad
vos anima atque istius inscia culpae '3 where a very simple
correction would be ‘ anima, a! atque ', three a’s for two: or
Juvenal x 54 ‘ Ergo supervacua aut perniciosa petunt-ur, which
suits neither metre nor context: an easy correction would be
‘ ErgO, supervacua aut ut perniciosa petuntur, Propter quae fas
est genua incerare deorum Ρ ’

We come to a much vexed and most vexing passage in 111
4 9 ‘ Me fabulosae Volture in Apulo Altricis (Nutricis) extra
limen Apuliae ἐ here Apuliae cannot be right, as first the
repetition of Apulo and Apuliae seems to have no point3 and
then the a is essentially long. The Greeks for meta-ical pur-

poses osten lengthened short syllables in proper names3 and
in such words the Latine followed them3 and even lengthened

occasionally such syllables in Latin words : thus we have Apsilia
