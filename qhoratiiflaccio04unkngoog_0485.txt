SATIRES.

1. A.

OY, disguised in a mssk of a gisnt's head, which completely conceals bis
whole person, scaring his phymata ς one of whom himbles beek-

· wards in his slnrm, whilst the other makes his escape with all speed. The

Minerva on the cippus is merely introduced to balance the composition. 'l'he
naturalistic treatment of the foreground, the picem-iul arrangement of the
actor-s, and, most important evidence of au, the want of defined soenic cha-
racter in the mask itself, combine to betrsy (so far ss my judgment goes)
the purely modern origin of this very elegant gem3 which however has passed
muster for antique with all previous critice. Black agate. (Blncns.)

Ι. n. Curm having a bont nt wrestling with Pan. 'l'he attributes of each
are suspended, behind, from his own peculiar tme, Cupid's quiver from the
myrtle, Pan’s syrinx from the cene out of which it was mede. 'rho torch of
one, the crook of the other, are thrown under foot. The little god is evi-
dently “master of the situation? haring seized his adversar-y by his long
esra, who vninly attempts to disengsge himself. This charming composition
probably typifies the conquest of aa by love, expressed in s rebus on the name
of the sylvsn god.

11. Δ. Dumna-emt, s member of the college of Ambuhioe, blowing the
double-ilum, and pirouetting swiffly to the sound, so as to expnnd the skirts
of her very scanty damry, and fully to display her figure. Four centul-ies
aster Horace’s age Ammisn complains that the number of these professionis
at Rome exceeded three thousand. 'l'his engrsving of master-ly execution
belongs to the early Imperial school. '

11. n. Mnnum’s Han, with the eyes opem the later version of the idea
of the Destructive Principle. Good Greek work. Serd. (King.)

111. Bos-r or Α Musa, her hair very elaborately dressed. 'l'he beo, lyre,
and name in the field have been added, to produce s pertrait ol* Sappho, by a
modern hand, which amusingly betrays itself by its abeund orthography. 'rho
first of the attributes wss suggested to the would-be impr-over by the epithet
“ Pieriam Bee” applied to the poetess by Christodorus, in describing her statue
then standing in the Gymnasium of Zeuxippus at Byzantium. 'rho intsglio is
sn admirable specimen of the best Roman style. Sard. (Marlborough.)
