pare the third letter in the signature of Theseus to a cun-13 or, as Agathou
prefers it, to the Scythian bow (Ath. X. 454). It must be borne in mind
that the poete always term Scythicus the bow which, in early art, is the pecu-
Iiar weapon of Hercules. He only assumes the club in his encounter with
the Nemean lion, after his arrowe prove of no avail against the beast's im-
penetrable hide. 111 the same primitive style of art, as yet full of the tradi-
tions of Pliny’s “Asiatic,” that is, Assyrium School, Hercules knows nothing
of the picturesque wild-olive trunk with which mature Greek teste anned
him, but bears, ae in the present instance, the metat mace, such as his proto-
type Sandan wields on the Babylonian cylinders. Hercules ie here repre-
sented as a youth according to the rule of primitive art, which, for some
aesthetic reason, was in every case reversed by the succeeding school. Thus
the ancient beardless Herculea, Neptune, dcc. become in the perfected style
boarded and mature figures, whilst the originally bearded Hermes, Achilles, &c.
are converted into smooth-saced youths. Sard scarabeoid. (King.)

XXIII. Α. Α Ron, in the act of springing up from her recumbent position,
and turning round her head to hatten, as if startled by some suspicions sound.
This animal· is here drawn with such truth to Nature as to be immediately
recognienble sor that smallest of the deer kind, the Italian capriolo or capu-etto,
still plentiful in the Tuscan Mar-emme, where its chase has the same char-ms
for the native sportsman as of old for his Tyrrhene ancestors. This very
graceful intaglio sully evinces that Etruscan Art (and the same observation
applies to Assyrian and Phoenician) had, in the delineation of animala, com-
pletely emancipated itself from all archaic stiffness, which it never succeeded
in doing as regards the human figure. 'rhat the present work belongs to the
Tyrrheno school is demonstrated by the careleesly executed berder that
encloses the design, manifestly added as an indispensable finish to the signet,
whereas in pure Greek engravings (sor one of which this intaglio might other-
wise be taken in virtue of its elegnnce and life), the enclosure is always
formed by a single, fine line. Sard scarabeus. (Maskelyne.)

XXIII. n. Lron nummo nom< Α suo. This subject being a common,
almost national type of the coins of Phoenicia, this very fine engraving is
possibly due to some Tyrion artist, although the gem itself was found at
Vulci. The work is remarkable sor its extreme finish, even the difference in
the hides of the two animale being carefully expreseed. To add to the
curiosity of thie scarabeus, the back is carved in relies into the figure of a
warrior, who, one knee bent, grasps his spear, and list-s his finger as if to en'-
jein silence, being manifestly lying in ambusb. This camec is of the same
finished workmanship with the intaglio, and undoubtedly proceeds from the

same hand. Such archaic relievi are of the highest rarity. Sard. (Demi-
doff. Imp. Gem. 111. 2.)
