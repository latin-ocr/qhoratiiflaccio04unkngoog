without amc (of which covering the head was the most ancient sig-n), as being
ι a kindly and familiar deity. Sard. (King.)

11. n. Ae· Sunt-mum, seated, and extracting a thorn from the foot of a
girl, whose gestures speakingly declaro her pain and solicitude. This sub-
ject, on account of the pleasing conti-ast it affords in the figures and attitudes
of the actors, was very popular with the gem-engravers, and doubtless equally
ao with their models, the painters of antiquity. Pluma, divided by a white
band, the rare jaspis monoyrammoe of Pliny. (Pi-aun.)

ART OF POETRY.

A.

HE Parnon Gonnsssns or ‘run Pomc Am, represented as engaged in

its cultivation. Erato, muse of amatory verse is tuning her cithara,
whilst Polyhymnia, of the epis, is declaiming with a scroll in her hand.
Between them is placed the Dionysiae cista mystica, supporting dramatic
masks. In the background an attendant raises aloft a basket contain-

pair, seated on the thymele, or theatrical altar, twangs the lyre, whilst his
companion leaning upon his staff in the character of “ Old Man ’⁹ is declaim-
ing at the top of his voice. Of much interest, as clearly illusa-ating the

nature of the ancient mask, which formed a complete head-pisce to the per-
former. Sard. (Dr. Nott. Imp. Gem. IV. 69.)

Ο. Musa, on Porrima, seated and playing upon an instrument which
is neither lyra nor cithara, but the much more perfected barbiton “os many
strings,'' whence the grammarians derived its name. This was a Lydian in-
vention, and consequently adopted by the Asiatic Greeks. The lady is
clothed in the archaic costume, a thin tunic full of plaits, over which is
thrown a peplum. Costume and instrument together render it very probable
that this beautiful figure represents the Lesbian Sappho: christodorus
describes a seated statue of her as existing· in his own times (fifth century)
amongst those adorning the Gymnasium of Zeuxippus. To add to the in-
