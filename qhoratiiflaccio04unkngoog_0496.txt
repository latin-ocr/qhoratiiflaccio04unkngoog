xlv, n. Gmx WAn-uonsn, which a young esvnlier, standing on the off-
side, holds by the bridle. The ephippia, pndded housing, the antique substi-
tute for our eumbrous staffile, is aocurntely mede out in thie carefully-finished

XV. Α. Εεουωιηυε, one os the finest, ns well as most famous Greek hendo
nnywhere preserved in geme. Its dignity of expression is rivalled by the
besuty of the work, in which the treatment of the hair and sostly flowing heard
is worthy of particular observation. The name ΛΤΛΟΎ, “of Aulus,’' upon the
tabella in the field is the addition of a later owner, probably some eminent
physieian under the Empire. Sani. (Blaene.)

XVI. Α. Βοσυετ, driving s plough, drawn by a yoke of cicadae. This in-
sect, the Italian ciqala, may be distinguished from the beo, which it much re-
sembles in glyptio representatione, by its disproportionste head, huge eyes,
and, above au, by the strong, nei-mres tmversing its wingu. It is the leudest-
voioed of all insecta, producing a constent nnd shrill chirping through two
tubes in the chest, ss the anciente thought, or, ss the modern naturalists wiu

complnining little creature. Ite music, however, mede it sacred to Phoebus,

deviee, therefore, wss well sdnpted for the signet of n poet eonveroed into a

XVI. n. Ernuscu Gonnnss, equipped with a double pair of wings, nster
the fashion of nn Assyriam divinity, ssuffieient proof ofher orient-l origin. On
the coffer of Cypselus Artemis was depieted se wingod, to the great surprise os
Pausanias. The helmet worn by the present figure seems to indieste it as a

very primitive type of the Grecian Pelles. Banded sardonyx. (Thorwaldsem
Imp. Gem- Ι. 1.)

XVII. Α. Aius-roerus, surrounded by the divinities who inspired his very
plesssnt system of philosophy. 'l'hey are arranged in nn order thet exhibits
