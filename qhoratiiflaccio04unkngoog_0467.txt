XXIV. Δ. Gmx Youm trundling the trochus with ita hooked rod, clavus,
and carrying in his other hand a strigil, aa if returning from the exerciaea of
the palaestra, deemed by Horace so incompatible with the martial education of
the pristine Romans. Ita free drawing declares the work to emanate from the
Campanian school. Sard. (Blacaa.)

xm. n. Samus muing his roek with prodigious‘effort up a ποορ hill in
the realins of torment. 'I'he subject ia here treated in the perfected Greek
style, and affor-da a singular contrast with the archaic conception of the same
given at p. 154. (Berlin.)

XXV. Δ. BAccnue advancing, with his scyphus in one hand, and a grape-
bunch triumphantly raised alost in the other. The godis here depicted under
a very youthful form, according to the rulea of Roman art. Banded agate.

(King.)

XXV. n. BAccnuru’s Hm, ivy-crowned, from the shoulder hange the
distinctive nebris. 'l'he face has not by any meana the regular beauty of the
conventional Maenad-type, but has all the appearance of a pertrait, from the
life, of some emasculated youth thus disguised. Or it may possibly be the
head of some dissolute prince, like Ptolemy Philopator, who, according to
Plutarch (“ Cleomenes,”) spent all his time, when not drunk, in celebrating
mysteries, and beatinga tambourine about his palme, whence his subjecta gave

a noble specimen of Greek art at its full maturity, wan found in Sicily, and
presented by the Municipality of Palermo to the Austrian general, Count Selia.
It was afterwards bought by Wiczay for 300 gold (lucan. Sard. (Pulsky.)

XXVI. Parcus, seated, and lulling cupid to aleep upon her lap. She has
dim-med the little god, and hung up hia weapona from the tree under which
he repones. An exquisite engraving in the fineat Greek manner, and the mont
ancient representation drawn from th'e fable of cupid and Psyche that hau
ever been discovered. Sard. (Kestner. Imp. Gem. ΙΙ. 66.)

XXVII. Α. Εσιου carried off upon the Bull, whose back she has just
mounted out of aport, aa ia indicated by the easy unconcern of her attitude,
for aa yet the animal has not left the dry land. The nymph retains in her
hand the flowers, poppiea, and rosebuds she was gathering when first attracted
by the beauty and caressea of the milk—white bull whose form her celestial
lover had assumed. The torch she bears alludea to her original dedication of
herself to the service of Diana, with the obligatory vow of perpetual virginity.
ο Fine Roman work. (Sard. St. Petersburgh.)

XXVII. n. 'run roan-omarus or vrwo ἵπποις» Bonna, conjoined, and
forming a double-headed monster unique in its kind. An interesting subject
