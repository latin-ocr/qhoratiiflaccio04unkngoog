EPODES .

Ι. Α.

IOE'ORY, bearing a palm, and holding forth the laurel wreath. She
stands upon the fore-part of a galley‚ to indicate that the success she
announces to the world had been gained at sea, and the inscription mvi. m. r„
“Divi Julii filius,'' certifles that Augustus and Actium are here intended.
'rho idea of the type was probably borrowed from that of Antigonus’ medal

commemorating his signal victory over Ptolemy’s fleet off Cyprus. Sard.
(Hertz.)

1. a. Is1s, in her distinctim berned head-dress, and with the ibis perched
upon ber hand. In the field above are the⁴busts of Phoebus and Luna.
Plutarch mentions that Cleopatra, aster her marriage to Antony, assumed the
title of the ‘⁸ N ew Isis‚'’ and made her appearance in public in the dress of that
goddess: giving at the same time to her twin sone, Ptolemy and Alexander,
the names of the Sun and Moon. Au this account harmonicen so exactly
with every particular of the gem here giren, that it may be confidently re·

ceived as a historic memorial of the arrogance of the last queen of Egypt.
Sard. (Κίος.)

11. Α. Mor-mia Enim reclining. From her head spring leaves, emblema of
her tmen from her limbs wheat-ears to the sacred number, five, for her
harvests3 for sceptre she bears the branch of olive. A most ingeniously de-

wishing to embody the intense love of the Romans for the country and rural
pursuits. Appropriately engraved on the grass-green plasma. (Demidoff.
Imp. Gem. 11. 35.)

11. s. Hm or cows under a tree3 an interesting example of Grecian
taste in grouping animals. The compact and symmetrical arrangement of
the component figures leads to the inference that the prototypo was some
celebrated cattle-picce in bronze, like that on which the same of Myron was
founded. Sard. (King.)

111. Α. Tua Canum Nasu-s, who, after carrying Deianira across the
Eurotas, becomes fitally amitten with her char-ms. 'rho enamoured look with
which the shaggy monster ganea upon liis sair burthen, and the tightness os
his μοι), together with her unavailing· attempt to escape, are rendered by the
old Etruscan artist with all the grotesque realism of primitive art. It will be
observed that “ the Centaur in the present figure has not all the legs of a
horse, but for the forelegs those of a man,” the very thing· that stirpi-ised

Pausanias in his representation upon the Coffer of Cypselus (v. 19, 7 ). But
