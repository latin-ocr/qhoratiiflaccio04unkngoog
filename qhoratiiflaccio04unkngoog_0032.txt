xxii INTRODUOTION

rently imitated by Claudian when he speaks of the Rhine and
Danube as ‘ boreae Martique sodales ’. Both virgil and Horace
are fond of allusions to the Hebrus: the latter speaks of it as
‘ nivali compede vinctus '. It is likely enough the point of the
allusion was to be found in some lost Greek poet: and how
many of the earliest Greek poetical legends were connected
with Thrace! And yet Bentley’s ‘ euro ’, the dedicating the
dry leaves to a cold boisterous wind seems to us a far more
appropriate thought. If not in Horace’s time, yet very soon
after, Ἕβρος and εὖρος must have been almost or quite identical
in the Greek pronunciation; and the corruption, if it be one,
doubtless dates very far back, long before Claudiam or the
scholiasta. Still more enticing is Ianus Ulitius’ emendation
in Epist. 1 18 46 ‘Aeoliis (i. e. Cumanis) onerata plagis’ for
the ‘Aetolis ’ of MSS.: see Gratius Cyneg. 35 and Pliny nx
2 § 11. Bentley thinks Horace would have rather said
Gwnani35 but there appears an almost satirica] elevation of
style in this epistle. And if 6 Aetolis ’ has any meaning at
all, would he have been more likely to bring the Calydonian
boar into a familiar epistle ⁴?

Still less than any of the above proper names can I accept
in Carm- 11 13 14 ‘ navita Bosporum Poenus perhorrescit neque
ultra. cet.’: what can it mean P Horace, illustr-ating his own
unlooked for peril, says that men only guard against dangers
‚near at hand and expected, while it is often the unforeseen that
carries off men and nations: the soldier fears the Parthian
arrows‚ the Parthian fears Italian chains. Why then should
the Punic skipper fear nothing besides or beyond the straits
of the Bosporus? what special business has he there? surely
nearer home there are his own Syrtes, at least as perilous ⁴?
The scholiasts often take a common-sense view of things:
Acron says 6 aut Poenum pro quolibet nauta dixit, aut Bos-
porum pro quolibet freto ': Porphyrion 6 Bosporum. Fauces
sunt Pontici marie, unde longissime Africa sit: quod (Ρ quid)
ita Poenus navita eum perhorrescat? numquid ergo Bosporum
pro quolibet freto posuit Ρ ’ If ‘ Bosporum ’ can mean the
