402 DESCRIPTION OF [enne.

Ι. 23), “ Vidimus apud Antium promoveri simulacra Fortunarum ad danda
responsa.” The ant, that proper attribute of Ceres as the first builder of
granai-ies, may allude to Fortune’c despotin tway over the fruita of the earth,
or else io, like the ram, a kind of rebus on the name of Bantius, as the ⁸‘ poor
cultivavor of the country” whoee special devotion to the goddess of Antium
Horace noticec in this ode. From the identity in style, equally with type.
itis almost demonetnble that this gem wan the actual signet of this money-er
of Augustus. Praee. (King.)

XXXV. n. Foru-mm Panaenum, carrying Neptnne’s delphin and trident,
to signify that she is “mistress of the seas,'’ and, to express the same notion
more forcibly, borne upon the back of “ the tyrano of the Western wavess’

'Capricornum An early Roman work. Sardonyx. (Dr. Nost, Imp. Gem.
w. 11.)

XXXVI. Δ. Sacmrmn ‘ro Jnrmn. A Roman in his toga, with covered
head, “sacrifioe ritu‚'' and bearing the bowl of libation‚ accompanied by the
popa armed with hia pole-axe, ic advancing towards the god, who sits en-

throned upon a losty pedennal. Fine work of the Augustan period. sard.
(Blaene.)

XXXVI. n. Vim-oms, in the character of Hygeia giving her serpent to
drink out of a patera. The union of these very diverse divinities in one person

can only be explained by supposing that the owner of the aig-net wished equally
to court the influenoe of both. Fine Greek style. Sard. (Blaene.)

XXXVII A. M. Aaron, a contemporary pertrait. There ia something
of the Herculea-type in the mmy cast of the features, in fact the Triumvir
boasted οἱ· his descent from the Heraclide Autan, and used among his troops
(recorda Plutarch) to affeci: the coetume of the demigod coming out in a lion’s

hide and carrying a club for a ενοι-ἀ. Sard. (Capi-anesi, Imp. Gem. IV.
91.)

XXXVIII. B. annn Hm> covered with the skin of an elephant, sorm-
ing a species of helmet. Cleopatra-Selene first appears on her coins in this
singular head-dress. Aa thie queen’c husband, Physcon, also assumes the
same comme, it ie probable that he chose to figure thus as the Libyar Her-
culeS, in opposition to the Thebon, the character under which the Macedonian
kings were regularly depicted. The reason commonly assigned, an allusion
to the great force of war elephante he possessed, is altogether untenable. In
old art the bridea of Hercules, Omphale or Iole, wear the hero’s own equip-
ment, and by the same right Selene puts on the elephant-mank. Under the
Romana this head became the established type of the provime Africa, and
therefore distinguishee much of the mintage of Alexandria. But the fine work
of the present gem carries it back to the Ptolemaic period. Sard. (Blacas.)
