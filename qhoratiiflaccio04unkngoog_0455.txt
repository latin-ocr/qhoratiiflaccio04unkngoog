XVII. s. Mnmnva Mnmca sacrificing the butterfly of life upon a blazing
altar, decorated with garlanda and a patera. The serpent, special attribute
of the goddess ιιι this character, is seen affixed to a cippus behind. 1 am
strongly tempted ω discover,’ m this singular design, a record os a curicus fact
mentioned by Plutarch in his Life of Pericles. In building the Propyloea of
the Parthenon, one of his best workmen fell from a great height, and was so
injured that his life was despaired of by the surgeons. But Pallas, appearing
in a dream to Pericles, reveeled a medicine to him whereby the man was
speedily and completely cured. Pericles, in testimony of gratitudo, made a
statue of the “ Athene of Health,'' placed close to the altar in the Acropolis,
and still existing there when Plutarch wrote. Of this statue a copy is pro-
=bably preserved in this gem, at least its character harmonizes well with all
the requirements of such a theory. The letters in the field are the initials
of the Roman, for whom the signet was engraved. Sard- (Κίος.)

XVIII. Δ. Hancums sinking under the load of his troubles, but succoured
by an aged deity with} mighty winae, and holding· for attribute the laurel-
branch. In the latter god Ruspe thinks he recognizes Saturn, but this ex-
planation is untenable‚ for that deity nowhere intervenes in the history of the
labours of his grandson3 and, what is more, satum had been stripped of all
power, and preserved only an otiose dignity in Olympus long before Hercules
began his career. But the style of the work, which is indubitably Etruscan,
declares the subject to be tinctured with the melancholy spirit of that religion,
and that we here behold Char-un) god os death, Horace’s ‘⁴ Satelles Orci‚”
bringing the surest of all relies to the misery of the despairing hero. '1⁸0
mark the benevolent intention of the “ officer of Death‚” the artist has, with
much taste, placed in his hand the lustral laurei-branch (the established in-
strument of purification in the funeral rites) instead of the ponderous mall,
Charun’s proper badge when he figures merely as the genius of Destruction
—the character in which he commonly appears on the Etruscan sarcophagi.

XVIII. n. Srmsx recumbent, wearing a curicus radiated head-dress. A good “
example of the archaic Greek style, as yet little advanced upon its Assyrian
original. In· the system of symbolical imagery, cultivated in the first times at
N ineveb, the male sphinx, combined man and lion—apt emblem os the war-god
N esi-gal, was the most frequent, yet a female sphinx of exquisite design, like
that on the coins of Chios, has been discovered at the same place. Although
the male figure is frequent enough in early Greek art, yet as sculpture advanced
