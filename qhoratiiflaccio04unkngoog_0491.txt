v1. A Ruun Fam-fom- litt-10 animala, apparently dormies, are sot ·

down to nibb103 a magnificent vine-leaf forming their ubloeloth, in the
centro of which stands a ciqala, to enlivon tho benquot with his musio. The
nent Etruscan bordon· enolosing this unique ‹lesign proven it to have belonged
to tho prosperous times of Magna Gmoin. Ant-ique pute. (Kestner. Imp.
Gom. 111. 94.)

VII. Mun, with squat note, ancl gaping mouth, full of the expression of
rog-niel) buffoonery, and which, ιιι tho pietur-ee in the MSS. of Terence show,
was assigned to the character of the humorons slave, tho Davus of the picco.
'I'he letters give tho mmo of the owner of the signet, probably sorno oome-
dian, a C. Clodius, whose cognomen commenoed with Ha . . . San-d. (Pr-aun.)

V111. A. Tim mlum Pinnos, neated nt hin dinnor, and benet by the
Han-pies whom Hercules is soar-ing away by the mere twang of his bowutring.
This mythic King ol' Bithynia had, on the false nocumtion of their step-
mother, put out tho eyes ofhin sons, for which Jupiter puninhed him with blind-
ness, ond sent these ill-omenod fowle to tol-ment him, and much away his
food. From their pla-grue ho was delivered, aooording to the usual legend re-
lated by Apollonius Rhodius, in return for his hospitality to tho Argonauta,
by two of tho band, Zetes and Calais, the winged sona of Boreas, who chased
the Hau-pies away as far as tho Strophades isles, and forced them to swenr
never to return. But tho Etruscan artist has here, as in so many other-onnes,
followed another version of the story, and mule Hercules tho deliverer of tho ι
afflictati king. 'l'he tole is cleverly told by the helplem attitude of the blind
old man, groping with both hands for the meam, and by the fell ποορ ol' the
doeoending birds. Sard. (Caetellani Gema. Brit. Mus.)

VIII. B. 'I'Ann Ourna, of the Corinthiun pattena, as this kind of embossed
work was named. It io adorned with a friezo in half-telier of tho Insunt
Bacchus, mounted on ιι gont, and led along by yout'hfnl Fauna. 'this gem
may with good reason be supposed n ffithful oopy of some celebrated piooo of
plato existing at the timo it wan executod, like these mea by tho chusar
when-icles, tho chief glory of the beauffet of the Macedonian kings, and which
finally adorned tho triumph of P. AErniliua over Perseus. The drawing of
this little gem is oo skilfuuy managed aa to produco tho effect of great magni-
tude· m the object it displayn, and such doubtlees wan the actual character of
itu prototypo. For Alexander' a eucnemon having the aoeumulaoed neuun-es
of Asin and Egypt at their command ouri-led their magnifioonoo in tho article
of plato to nn extent partenay inooneeinble to modern ideas. To quote a
single example, in tho Baoohio processioa exhibited by Ptolemy Philadelphus,
Callixenus describen amongst an infinity of other immense vensels of gold,
two high Corinthiam cratere, elaborataly chased with figures, of tho enormous
oepnoity of eight metretae (nixty—four gallam) ench. Into Greek work.
