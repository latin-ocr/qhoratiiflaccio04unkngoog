statue of the god is thereby metamorphosed. A very curious jeu d'esprit

doubtless enveloping some very profound philosophica] mystery. sard.

XX. n. Mssa or Δ ΒΑοσιωετιι, in frent sace, the feamres inspired with
frenzy, and the mouth open, as if shoutiug forth the cry of the Maenads. 'l'he
hair is bound with ivy, and also circled with stringe. of large beads, which ap-
pendage, from its constant attachment tosimilar masks, probably consisted of
hollow spheres of metal, and formed the crepundia that sounded like bells with

every movement of the head. Sard. (Maskelyne.)

KELETON, emerging from a hugo urn, decorated with cross torches, allu-

sive to the Eleusinian M ysteries, and plucking a branch from a palm-tree-

This remarkable desig-n obviously and ingeniously expresses the winning of
