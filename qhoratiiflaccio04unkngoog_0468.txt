as unmistalnbly exhibiting the inspimtion of Assyrian art, the winged bnll
being the proper attribute of Nin, the N inevefiah Hercules. Sard scarabeus.
(Millingen. Imp. Gem. 1. 60.)

XXVIII. Δ. Νεπσιω nm Aurunmn, borne over the tranquil oceanupon
the back of a sea-horse, guided by Cupids. The goddess wields a rudder,
but her lord, sested in an attitude expreesing the utmoet placidity, has been
despoiled of his trident by Leve, who is seen carrying it off triumphantly, in
order to inaure the uninterruptcd continuance of the calm. An elaborate
composition of the Roman school at its best period, very gracefully embody-
ing all the ideas befitting the festival-day of the ruler of the waves. (Berlin.)

XXVIII. n. Nmun urging his suit to Amymone, daughter of Danaus,
the nymph coyly unveiling herself, seems to give ear to his pmposals, 'rho
pitcher in her hand alludes to the fount of Lerna, a gift to her from the lord
of ntem. Or it may etei-nire her charity in carrying water to supply the
Argives during a great drought, to reward which she was exempted from the
punishment of her sister Danaides in the infernal regions. The treatment of
the group demonstratos the gem to be copied from some then admired
piece of sculpture3 in fiet, one almost identical in composition is described by
Christodorus amongst the other bronze statues collected to decorate the gym-
nasium of Zeuxippus at Constantinople, in the fifth century. Antique paste-
(Kestner. Imp. Gem. Ι. 64.)

XXIX. A. Nam Yourn, standing and grasping a serpent tightly by the
neck. A figure, precisely similar, only sested, is explained by Winckelmann
(⁴⁴ Pierres Grai-ees de Stosch,'' p. 227), aa representing a person using divina-
tion by serpents. He points out that the Hebrew name for divim, “ Mena-
chash,” is actually derived from the word signifying serpent, and to show that
the same notion prevailed amongst the Greeks, quotes Snidas as making
Telegonus the inventor of ‘⁴ augury and devinetion by serpente-’⁹ It in
therefore probable that the Italiote hero, son of the sorceress Circe by
myaces, may be the personage here commemorated. The particular subject
may have been selected as allusive in its nature to the sense of Pius, cognomen
os the owner of the signet. Sard. (Beverley.)

XXIX. s. Two Mna, wearing conica! pilei. sested in a galley with cars, and
holding erect between them a tall amphora. This curicus and unique design
shows us the Cabiri‚ the great gods ochlasyic, or pre-historic Greece, and her
numerous colonien. They were worshipped as the inventor-s of all the useful arts
of life, especially of navigation and agriculture, which character is very expres-
sively alluded to by their attributes upon this gem. Their name is Phoeni-
cian, signifying “ The Mighty Ones,'’ and is literally translated by the Latin
Dim· Potes, by which title Varro mentions their worship at Rome. 'I'he ori- ”
ginal population of both Troy and Latium was Pelagio (aa Niebuhr has
pointed out in discussing the legend of AEneas' landing in Italy), and the religion
