spirit in which Horace’s latest English editor Mr. J. E.
Yonge of Eton deals with his author. Amid his laborious
duties he has found time to improve in each edition on what
he had done before 3 and in the last has not disdained to attend
to the smallest evidence offered by MSS. and the minutest
dicta of his critical predecessore Bentley, Lachmann and
others.

'I'hough I have carefully avoided admitting any correction
into the text, except where opinion is nearly unanimous that
some correction must be made, I feel sure that many passages
yet need alteration, though Ι am not satisfied with any that
has been proposed: indeed aster so many centuries of criti-
cism it is not easy to get a new hearing on any passage; and
very many of us prefer from long habit our own mumpsi-
muses to the most brilliant sumpsimus. Yet in Carm. 1 32
15 ‘ mihi cumque salve ' cannot surely be right3 nor in Serm.
11 6 59 ‘ Perditur’ ; nor in the Ars 65 ‘ paliis’ ; though neither
‘ medicumque salve ², nor ‘ porgitur '‚ nor ‘ palus diii aptaque ’
sounds to me Horatian. In other passages the MSS. vary in
such a way as to prove that the readings of most must be, of
all probably are conjectural‚ as in Carm. 1 12 31; 11 3 11; 11
6 17 ; Epod. 9 17 3 Epist. 11 2 199. In very many cases half
of the MSS. (often the ‘ antiquissimus Blandinius ' alone or

with a few others) have one reading, the others 80 different a
one as to throw doubt on all, in 0111· utter ignorance of their
mutual relations : 80 Carm. 111 24 4 ‘ Apulicum‚ publicum ’ or
‘ Ponticum’3 1 8 2 ‘'I'e deos’ or ‘Hoc deos’3 111 5 37 ‘inscius'
or ‘aptius ’ ; 11 4 36 ‘Indecorant ’ or ‘Dedecorant ' 3 6 21 ‘ vic-
tus ’ 01· ‘flexus ’ς 7 15 ‘ pater’ or ‘pius ’ς Serm. 11 3 303
‘ demens ’ or ‘manibus’ 3 Epist. 1 18 19 ‘ Dolichos ’ 01· ‘ Do-
cilis ’3 11 2 212 ‘iuvat ’ 01· ‘levat’; and the like. 0111· per-
plexities are much the same whether we give or do not give a
preponderating weight to the ‘ antiquissimus Blandinius ’; and
often too the relations of the scholiasts to the MSS. are not
easy 1ο determine.

Bentley's tact in the use of manuscripts is so great that Ι have
