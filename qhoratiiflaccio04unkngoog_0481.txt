lower parts. 'l'his very type Sextus Pompey, when master os the scas, put
upon his coinage, conveying a very significant menace to the hostile Triumvi-
rate. 'rho present gem, therefore, which is of fine Greek work, may, from
the analogy of circumstances, be supposed the signet of some older Siciliam
admiml, perhaps of Philistus himself. Sard. (Dr. Nott. Imp. Gem. 1. 93.)

X. n. Muenna, standing in a threatening attitude, as she may be sup—
posed picmred by Apollodorus (in his sar—famed painting at Pon-gamus), com-
manding the destruction os the impious Ajax. A Greek gem of exquisite
finish. Sard. (Hertz.)

XI. Α. Bor, trundling the bronze hoop, the “Grecian trochus,'' by means
of a hooked rod, datis,- a subject which clearly illustratet! the mode of using
this phything. 'l'he palm-brenel: bound with ribbons‚ toenc‘oe, borne upon his
shoulder, prodaims the boy victor in the rece, that very favourite amusement
with the Greek ephebi from whom the Romans adopted it to the neglect of
their ancient and martial exercises. Sard. (Elaean.)

XI. Β. Cvrms chaetising the panther of Bacchus. One holds the beust
by the tail, the other thwacks him with his master's own pedum. 'l'his pretty

allegor-y may express repentance for some offence against love committed

XII. Δ. Sum surprising a nymph asleep, who appears just wakened from
her elumber by the rude attack. Thia scene, of which the ancients were

very fond, from the picturesque contr-ast it affords between the voluptuous
beauty of the one, and the comio hideousness of the other actor, ie usually
explained as the amour of Jupiter with Antiope. This intaglio is prettily
executed in the Middle Roman manner, but its special interest lies in the

rarity of the material, a true emen-ald of the most perfect colour and purity.
(Blaene.)

XII. n. Sow, seemingly from the ferocity of her aspect intended sor Pham,
the dreedful Wild·sow of Crommyon, the shying of whom was the first of the
exploits of Theseus. This feet of the hero’s was certainly one not to be over-
looked by the Tyrrheno artists, partin-l aa they were to the representation of
monstrent beasts. The Romans, ancient and modern aliine, use “ troia '⁹ as
the most vituperative epithet for a woman like the object of Horace’s satire
in this piece—my reason for selecting it where an appropriate and admi-'siole
illustration was not easy to find. Sard. scarabeus. (Dr, Nott. Imp. Gem.
1. 52.)

XIII. A. Tim Stes Acunum, who presides over part of winter, pout-ing
forth the ruins from a huge amphora, type of the seeson that falls under his
