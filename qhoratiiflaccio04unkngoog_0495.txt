goddess of Carthago, two conditione tending to prove this gem the signet of a
native of that metropolis. Unusually fine work of-Roman date. Red jasper.
(Ducheca of Grafton.)

XI. A. Srmnx, aeated, the exact type of the coins os Chios. Black jasper.
(King.)

XI. B. 'hm Ims οι· Tuo-m, the Egyptian Hermes, on which account the
bird carries the caduceus of the Grecian god, supporting upon its head asmall
figure of Harpocrates. This singular combination must have for moral
the wisdom and profitablenees of keeping one's own couneel, the same warning
as conveyed by the pearl-fettered Harpocratee already introduced (p. 102).
Lapis-lazuli.

XII. A. Tm: 'fumun-rm, emblem of Sicily, bearing in its centre a Me-
dusa’s head, here unfurnishod with the usual wings. 'l'he earu of bearded
wheat, triticum (still the only kind grown in Italy), refer to the ataple product
of Ceres’ own island, whilst the mallet declares the gem the signet of one
Malleolus, a regular cognomen in the Poblicia fimily. 'I'he curione figure,
the Triquetra, had ite origin in the Indian caete-mark, the “Swaatika” (the

comparing the present head with the Socrates already given, the differ-enee in
the expression, and also in the shape of the beard‚ shows clearly enough that
they are intended for different persons, although both partaking of the same
sarcastic, “ ironical ’' disposition. Sardoine. (King.)

XIII. Aac, carrying panniers (clitella), laden with the regular produce of
a Roman farm, amphorae of wine, geeae, chickens, and pigeons. Sard.
(Thomaldaen. Imp. Gem. 11. 99.)

XIV. Α. Sama-annm· of fine yellow jasper, bearing the name, in a car-
touche, of Amenophis 11„ whose date ia fixed in the flsteentb century before
our era. 'I'he extremely free and naturali-etio drawing of the bull provee, how-
ever, of imelf that thia intaglio cannot belong to that remote period, or, in-
deed, to pure Egyptian art of any period, but that it must be a copy, either
Phoenician or Ptolemaic, improved from a ruder and much more ancient original.
'I'he Phoeniciana, in fact, were admirable in their drawingc of animala, and, be-
