410 DESCRIPTION OF [onas.

golden epple thrown down by her competitor, Hippomenes. J ustly styled by
Winelrelmann “ one of the most perfect engi-avings to be seen anywhere;”
and that acute judge thinks he discovers in it “the idea of the Juno of
Homer, who moves swister than thought itself.’' 'I'he treatment of the
graeeful contours os the maiden’s body, so plainly discernible through the
gauzy texture of her voluminous drapery, is particularly to be admired.
Greek work of the most perfect style. Amethyst. (Berlin.)

XV. “Summa'' Titus Tatius, the colleague of Romulus: the exact por-
trait put upon their mintage by the family Titia (claiming descent from him)
in the last century of the Republic. This head, therefore, lilre those of
Romulus, Numa, Ancus, δια, similarly seen en the consular denarii, could
only have been copied from the statues of the kings in the Capitol, which
were standing there as late as Pliny’s times, who quotes-them as works of the
age of their originale. They must consequently have been done by Etruscan
statuaries, which indeed is manifest from their archaic design, as preserved
in these copies. Sard. (Capraneai. Imp. Gom. lv, 90.)

XVI. A. Tan-unus catching eagerly at the waters that sui-round him, hut
fly backwards in a heap from his touch. The retreating clement is expressed
by the usual conventional wave puttam, which curiously, though effectively,
renders its rapid motion in the legend. This intaglio, for admirable drawing
and exquisite finish, stands amongst the first of the Etruscan school. Sard
scarabeus. (Blacas.)

XVI. n. Two Wanaloss conducting a third, apparently wounded, who
supporta himself by placing his anns over their shoulders. 'l'his subJect is
often met with upon Roman gems, and has received various, all unsatisfactory,
explanations; sor example, the Marlborough is described as “The Death of
Epaminondas :” elsewhere the same is termed “ Pietas Miliaria? It, how-
ever, can only represent (taking all the circumstances into account) the
'l'hree Horatii, and the eaqle-crest on the helmet of the principa! figure was ’
certainly introduced to leave no doubt as to the nationality of the champions.

'l'he type probably became in later times a recognized emblem of stater-nal
love. Sard. (Duc de Luynes.)

xv11. A. Surum«, in his serpent-car. He bears the scythe and pruning-
book, as having first introduced the arta of agriculture into Italy, whither he
came an exile from Crete. There he was hospitably received hy Janus,
whom another tradition, preserved by Plutarch (“ Numa ”), makes a colonist
from Thessaly, and who had brought the aborigines of latium to lire under
his government. Aquarius, the Sign, appears in the field overhead‚ because
that was the first Horae, or most benign aspect of the planet, as Dorotheus
teachcs
