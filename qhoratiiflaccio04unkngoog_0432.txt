388 DESCRIPTION OF [onze.

Il. A. Auousrus: a pertrait taken in middle life, and certainly the finest
amongst the innumerable repetitions of the subject extant. This work may
well have proceeded from the hand of his engi-aver, Dioscorides, for it fully
comes up to Pliny’sjudgment on that artist‚ “ divi Augusti imaginem simillime
expressit.” The letters in the field have of course been understood, in eom—
pliance with the prevailing mania for discovering artists’ signatures everywhere,
ns indicating the work of that famous calutum but the absurdity of such
interpretation is too patent to require discussion. It simply means “ J upiter's,''
possibly declaring the dedication of the ring at his shrine for an ez· voto:
certain it is that the same word occurs on other gems with other subjectis also.
Sard. (Beugnot, Imp. Gom. IV. 93.)

ΙΙ. s. J urm-m Axon, ‘mu “ BnAnnnnss,” as this subject is always ex-
plained. Some see here an Augustus in that character, but the diadem round
the head suffices to prove that the personage cannot be s Roman imperator,
but a Greek king. There is, indeed, good reason to believe that this gem pre-
serves to us an exact idea of Apelles’ masterpieoe, the “ Alexander grasping a
Thunderbolt,” painted for the Temple of Ephesus, and for which he received
the fabulous remuneration of nearly a ton-weight of gold (xx talenta anri).
The same mania for discovering· artists’ signatures has found one in the mco'r
also, although its barbarons orthography (the substitution of ΕΙ ‘for ι) and
clumsy lettering prove the inscription the interpolation of some propr-ictor
of the gem, later by many generations than its engraver. Sard. (St. Peters-

burgh.)

111. A. Tur. misr Vonos suso mr 'run Pom-s: Phryxus borne orer the sea
from Boeotia to Colchis upon the back, not of Aries, according to the usual
version of his story, but of Capricornus. The only conjecture that can be
offered to explain the change in his conveyance is that a complimcnt was
therein implied to Augustus, whose horoscope was that Siga, as he has
published to posterity by making it the type of one of his denarii. Capricornus
also is the ruler of the waves, his reign coinciding with the stormiest sesson
of Winter. The intrepid unconcern oi the boy, though surrounded by the
“ floating monsters of the deep” is cleverly expressed by the easiness of his
pose, and the playful gesture with which he seizes by the tail one of the
delphius that accompany his course. carneo. (Beverley.)

III. n. Burrenum, cnossiae ‘mn Srrx m Crimou's Bou, of which he has
taken sorcible possession, in quest of Cerberus. The amphora and lecythus,
regular companions of interment, are symbols intimating that the scene of the
voyage lies amongst the dead. The matter-of-fact way in which the hero
prepares to tnuffle the Dog of Heu with his lion’s-hide cloak has about it
all the ludicrous nai'vetc of archaic art. Etruscan style, very highly finished.
