INTRODUCTION

HOUGH it would be out of place in 911 edition like this

to dwell at any length on the criticism of our author,

yet in justice to myself 9 few remarks must be made. It will

hardly I think be disputed by competent judges that Horace

is 0119 of the most djffioult Latin writers, almost 01· quite 99

in the present edition.

It was in 1837 and 1838 that Orelli published his popular
edition, with the readings of the oldest Bernese and other
