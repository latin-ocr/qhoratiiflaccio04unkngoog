high relief, judging from the extreme minutenees of the finish, must belong
to a pre-Roman school. Cameo. (Dr. Nott, Imp. Gem. IV. 66.)

XXVI. Hm or Limane, aa she appears upon the coinage of Brutus.
'Phe style of thie fine work ie that of the last century of the Republic‚ whence
it may be insen-ed that its proprietor‚ a certain C. AElius, had joined the
same eide as Horace when at college. Sard. (Pi-aun.) h

XXVII. A. Onnum carrying un immense bowl and an uprooted pine-
tree, in allusion ιο their fighting the Lapithae with euch weapons at the nuptial
feast of Pirithous. 'l'he moneter's figure, on a cameo intended ιο embellish
a piece of plate for the festnl board, was clearly intended to read an apt leeson
upon the evile of unlimited indulgence in wine, ω which his own powerful,
semi-divine race owed ite destruction. Work in very high relies of the

Roman school. Cemeo. (Demidoff, Imp. Gem. II. 24.)

XXVII. Β. annornon, mounted on Pegasus, and spearing the Chimaera.
It will be observed that the bero weare the petasus of the Thessaliam, and

XVIII. B. Smn, or ΗΜ, with uplifted arms standing between two
netted gryphons. All tiu-ee seem by their uplifted hendo and open mouthsto
be crying aloud unto their god. 'l'he idea seems suggested by the chorus
of Cynocephnli hymning the setting sun, a constant picture in the Egyptian
“ Rimul of the Deadl' It in hardly possible to conjecture the hidden sense
of thie most weird-looking group, eo full of the dnrk symbolism of the Ense,
for both desig-n and style unmietnkably belong to the purely Asiatic clane of
Etruscan remeius. 'l'be Harpy is in archnic art the regular pereonification os
Denth, the gryphon of Phoebus, but only in his character of Apollo “ the
Destroyer.” 'that some reference to these ideae, intelligible at the time, was
intended here is tolerably certain, but what leeson the hieroglyph was intended
ιο convey to the beholder of its impression ie lost with the religion whence it

emanated. Serd scarabeus. (Cmpunari, Imp. Gem„ ΙΙΙ. 40.)
