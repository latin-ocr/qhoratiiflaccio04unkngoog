ring itself stands the device supposed to be engraved on the signet, being a
gryllus in the outline of a stork devouring a serpent, a bird sacred to Isis:
which in its turn is sunnounted by Apollo’s own raven. within the hoop
stands Victory in person. On the dexter· side is the dolphinffintwined trident
of Neptune, coupled with the crescent of Diana. On the sinister, the three
eonical objecta must be the apices (caps of office) of the flamen Dialis,
Martialis, and Quirinalis3 and thus is secured the favour of Jove, Mars, and
Romulus, with the least possible expenditure of space. They are followed by
the caduceus of Mercury, coupled with the torch of Phoebus. At the bot-tom
are placed the thyrsus of Bacchus and the club of Hercules. By this in-
genious allegory all the chief gods of the Roman pantheon are brought to aet
within the narrow area of this gem. ‘rho legend tells the world that it is
the signet of a certain “M. Varus, son of Quintilius ;” and therefore of the
same family as the subject of this ode. 'l'he R in the name has been
doubled merely by the error of the engi-aver. Sard. (Maskelyne.)

petasus, it will be observed‚ is here, ns in many other antique figures of him,
lot-med out of the upper shell of a tortoise. 'l'he disembodied spirit carries
a hay-branch, Juvenal's “humida laurus,’' the established instrument of

purification. Etruscan of the finest character. (Berlin.)

XXV. A. Nfflnsm, depicted here exactly as the poet Dionysius describes
her in his hymn to that goddess, “ measuring life with her cubit (fore-arm),
and ever bending her brow downwards under the bosom of her robe.” She
significantly exhibits her ann, that primitive instrument of mensuration, and
which gave its name to the cubit: a gesture inculcating moderation (modus
in its double sense) in conduct. In her other hand she holds a branch of
ash-tree, μελίαι, probably taken as her attribute in consequence of the specis.¹
use of that wood in making spesr-staves. The most celebrated statue of
Nemesis was that at Rhamnus‚ sculptured by Phidias, wit-h the utmost appro-
priateness‚ out of a block of Parian marble, which had been carried thus far
by the Persians under Xerxes for the purpose of making a. trophy therewith
to commemorate the victory upon which they counted as certain. This statue
similarly held in one hand an ash-branch, but in the other a basin engrared
with figures of Ethiopians. Upon her head was a crown composed of stags
and small figures ofVictory. (Pausan. Ι. 33.) 'l'he later types of the goddess
attempt to intensify the meaning of the idea she embodies by adding vingt,
and putting in her hands a measuring-rod and a bridle. Roman work of the

finest character. Sard. (Blacas.)
