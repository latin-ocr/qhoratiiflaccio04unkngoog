Mars upon the memor-able occasion when she captivated the affectione of that
deity. This design probably formed the pendant to the Wolf and Twins, a.
fiequentf subject sor Roman cumei. Agnte-onyx. (Beverley.)

X. A. Tun-u«, ‘ms Ernuscm Vmws, and therefore equipped with witige,
according ω the rule of Tyrrhene mythology. She is seated on the myrtle-
twined conjuga! altar. 'rhet such is the character of this altar is proved by
the appearance of one exaetly similar on nn aureus of Crispins's (Paris),
with the legend ms conweAmnvs. Upon her lap rests the spindle, and she
holds forth by the tip of the wings a bird, which may mean the far-snmed
iynx, the most potent of love-cbsrms, and which the goddess is recorded to
have occasionally lent to her special samariten to Jeson, for example, sor the
purpose of captivating Medea. The subject, which is engraved with the most
exquisite finish, plainly bespeeks the destination of the jewel itself—n betrothal
ring. It is of the Euhion peculiar to these Italiote rings, of solid gold, simply
but elegantly shnped, and with nn enormously expcnded fince. Ringe of thie
identicnl shspe are osten to be recognized upon the fourth finger of Etruscan
dames in their recumbent figures upon sarcophagi, a. fact which serves ns nn
additional confirmation of what has been advanced as to the original purpose
of the present specimen. (Hamilton Jewels. Brit. Mus.)

X. n. Curm, on cip-tm, liflzs his hand to heaven in the attitude of offering
a vow. The object of his prayer is evidently the captum of the Psyche but·
terfly, settled upon the flower a. short distance from her ardent pursuer. An
elegant idea, well adopted sor the device of c despeiring lover, and carried
ont with equal elegance in this pretty work. Sard. (Dr. Note. Imp. Gem-

11. 45.)

XI. Δ. Μωυσεῖ, by the sound of his double-liure, custing into a deep
elumber Argus, the ever-wakeful keeper of the cow, into which June had
mussomod her rival, 10. Roman style. (Berlin.)

xl. n. On οι· 'mn S1mn Dumna, engaged in ber never-ending task of
filling a lenky cistern with water from her ιιι-ιι. Her attitude‚ though ex·
tremely gnceful, is ingeniously contrived to express the extreme fitigue under
which she seems on the point of sinking. She is depicted in the same bridal
costume she wore when committing the crime sor which she is here pu-
nished, having on her arm a bracelet, and round her breasts the broad bendnge
worn in Greeee end Rome by women who had cessed to be virgins, for the

object expressed by Martial (xiv, 134)—

“ Fascis crescentes dominae compesce papillas
Ut sit quod capiat nostra tegatque manus?

'l'he drawing of the figure is so pure, and the execution of the csmeo is so

highly finished, as ω warrnnt its migument to thot extremely rare clm
