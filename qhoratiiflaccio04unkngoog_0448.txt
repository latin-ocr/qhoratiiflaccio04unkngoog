404 DESCRIPTION OF [onze.

‹lulcimer io now played‚ for the anciente never thought of twangingphe choi-ds
with the bne finger-ends. The scabillum was formed of thiu bronze platee
fontaned loocely together in the form of a ehoe-sole, and was worn by flute-

plnyere on the fect, being used for benting time to the notes of that instru-
ment. Surd. (Κεκίλιον. Imp. Gem. 11. 90.)

11. Α. Hm, in a Phrygiam cup, mund which is tied the royal diadem.
The costume naturally suggests Priam for the subject, but the features are
too harah and have too much individuality for nn ideal pertrait. More pro-
bably it is the likeness from the life of some petty Asiatic prime, and its

peculinr execution, almost Parthian, supporto this explanation. Snrd.
(Elam.)

11. n. Amineum arrayed, like Hercules, in a lion’e hide, strugg-ling
with a gryphen, which he throttlee3 whilst the monster, turning beck its
head, vainly strivee to tear his arm with its engle-bak, at the same time
plying its telone vigorously against hia body. 'l'his spirited group is the
earliest representation to be found in nrt drawn from the wild story which
Herodotus says (nr. 27) the Greeks had learnt from the Scythiam about the
“ one-eyed'’ (asima—spon) race in the sar North, ever wan-ing with the
Gryphono for their hoardod gold. The whole fnble may have originated in
an attempta> explain the similar combutta between men and symbolic munstero,
that flavour-ite theme of Assyrinn art, but its early currency in Europe is eri-
denced by this intnglio‚ anterior in style, by fun two centuries, ω the age of
Herodotus. Scarabeus of banded agate. (Feoli. Imp. Gem. Ι. 13.)

111. Α. Tun Gnmus or Dum, leaning upon his inverted torch. An
elegant form of the “Memento mori,” chonen for hin signet by a certain
Eugenius of the lower times of the Empire, ns is apparent from the charactere
in which his signature is engraved3 the name being written in its Latin form,
but in Greek letters. This gem, though very prettilv executed for itu period,

derives its chief interest from having once belonged to the Gallie Polycrates,
Μαι-αι, who presented it ω Mnie. de Vandiron. Sard. (Davideon.)

111. n. Mncunr conducting the soul of a youth to the obedes, and con-
signing him to Charon, who, with an nir of sympathy, politely assiste him to
enter his serry boat. A beautiful composition in the imperial Roman style,
very elaborately fininhed. Peridot. (Mnekelyne.)

IV. Δ. Aux, son or Omne, tearing away Cassandra (the “ virgo rapt? of
thie ode) from the altar of Pallas. 'Phe helplese despair of the supplinnt, and
the contempt for her protecti-ess manifected in the gesture of her :wishem are
