xxviii INTRODUOTION

gloss and have superseded ‘ et superum mare ’ or the like.
But both Ponticum and publicmn seem to have higher autho-
rity in their favour than it has: as Pontimmn, adopted by
Ritter, appears as much out of place as the Poenus in the
Bosporus, Ι have with much unwillingness accepted Lach-
mann's ‘ Terrenum omne tuis et mare publicum ', for Dim-he-
nwm sounds to me genuine, and terrenum to my ear has not a
Horatian ring.

Carm. 111 29 6 Aefulae, not Aeculae of all editions: thes is
found in some of the best MSS. of Horace, in the best of the
scholiasta, as well as of Livy, as shewn by Huebner in the
Hermes 1 p. 4263 who completos the proof by citing three in-
scriptione, one of them Greek, in which the gentile names
Aefolanus‚ Aefulsnus‚ Αἰφουλανός occur.

Epod. v 87 ‘ Venena (magnum) fas nefasque, non valent
Convertere humanam vicem ': Ι have thus arranged this ob-
scure passage, with one point of difference as Lambinus has
done: the meaning is ‘ venena (id quod magnum est) fas ne—
fasque valent convertere, humanam vicem non valent ⁹. Lam-
binus has shewn with his usual brilliancy that this is a good
Latin construction, citing among other passages Cic. ad Att.
x 1 4 ‘ istum, qui filium Brundisium de paee misit, . . . . me
legatum iri non arbitror ’ i. e. istum arbitror legatum iri, me
non arbitror. But maqwam I do not think can be joined with
‘ fas nefasque '3 Ι have therefore made it parenthetical, where
it seems to me to have much force. Venena can upset the
natural order of right and wrong, as shewn by what precedes:
comp. Virgil’s ‘ fas versum atque nefas ', Ovid’s ‘fasque ne-
fasque Confusam ruit: but they cammt change the retribution
due to mortals according to their deeds; which you therefore
will incur3 for ‘ Diris agam vos, cet.’: for this use of vicem
comp. ‘ fors et Debita iura vicesque superbae Te maneant ip-
sum '. The explanations of Orelli and others I cannot even
understand3 nor have any conjectures the least probability,
neither Bentley’s, nor Haupt's modification ‘ Venena maga non
fas cet.'; nor Keller's ‘ humana invicem '.
