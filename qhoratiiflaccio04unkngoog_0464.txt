420 DESCRIPTION OF [ones.

figure between the satyra and the huns, of which no traces are to be discovered
in the vase-paintings ς ‘Pan and his satyr-s arc now pictured with goat's legs
and horns; the fauns romain as before, but get human feet. 'I'his scarabeus,
of dai-k agate, is probably of insulan· Greek work. Plutarch relates (⁸⁴ Sylla'')
that at Nymphaeum, near Apollonia, are two inflammable springs always blazing.
A satyr, exactly like those painted, was caught lying asleep by the side of
one of them, and carried to Sylla. His voice was a mixture of neighing and
bleating, but no articulate sound, and the Roman, horror-struck at his hideous
aspect, ordered him to be set at liberty forthwith. What could this monster

have been, for it cannot be a mere idle story, ss Plutarch took an his details

from Sylla’s own commentarios P Perhaps a big bahoon, sole relic of a more
ancient sauna, like the lions that still infested Mount Athos at the time of

Xerxes' invasion. (Praun, now Brit. Mus.)

XVIII. s. Bos-1· or Δ murus-m. FAmc, in an attitude of violent, though
sportive exertion, plainly declaring that the whole figure was engaged in the
customary occupation of propping up a drunken Bacchus or Silenus. 'rho
sace is that of a handsome, rustic boy, retaining nothing· of the archaic Faunus
beyond the pointed ears, and affords an interesting compar-ison between the
refined later Greek conception of the sylvan deity and the grotesque, semi-
bestial embodiment of the same idea in primitive half-Asiatic art. sard.

XIX. A. Tum Wanaxoas, standing round a great oviform vase, into which
one of them is about to dip his hand. In the background rises a sepulchral
pillar of the Dorio order, supporting a tripod laid thereon horizontslly, so
that only the fire-pan is visiblc (the space not allowing im being placed emet).
'Phe importance of the event here depicted is manifest from the number of
gems upon which it occurs; all of Greek work, more or legs archsic. The
most probable explanation, therefore, of the subject makes it to be the three
Heraclidae, Aristodemus, Temenus, and Cresphontes, custing lots sor their
shares of the Peloponnesus, upon their conquest of that reg-ion (n. ο. 1104).
the most memorabis epoch in all Grecian history, and the occasion os the
colonization of Asia Minor and Italy by the dispossessed tribes. As the lot
which remained ‚last in the ura was to secure Messene, the richest of the
porticus, Cresphontes, the youngest, substituted for his pebble a pellet of
earth, which, dissolving in the water, necessarily remained there aster the
withdrawal of the other two. The column, or monument, speakingly alludes
to the deaths of Hyllus and his son Aristomachus, in their unsuccessffil
attempts at the same conquest; and as every detail in archaic art has a
meaning of its own, its Dorio style may declat-e the nationality that supplied
the invading force. The meaning of the double-bodied sphinx painted on the
vase is more difficult to conjecture, unless it be supposed to express the
Thebon origin of the great ancestor of the trio. Sard. (Duc de Luynes.)
