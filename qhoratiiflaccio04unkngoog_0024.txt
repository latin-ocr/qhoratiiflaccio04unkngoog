xiv INTRODUC'I'ION

Swiss manuscripts. These however were not given with the
aceuracy and completeness which are now required. The
chief merit of Ritter’s edition published in 1856 and 1857 is
a fuller and more accurate collation of these same menu-
scripts ; to which oollation Ι have had to trust entirely in the

satires and epistles. In 1864 Mr. O. Keller gave to the world '

his revision of the odes and epodeS‚ accompanied by a most
elaborate critical apparatae, a collation of the Paris manu-
scripts of the tenth and later contai-ies, the readings elicited
from Horace’s scholiasta, and the ‘ Testimonia Veterum ’.
We find also in this edition a collation by Mr. H. ‘Usener of
the oldest Bernese, which professes to be more accurate than
Ritter’s‚ with what truth Ι am unable to say. Keller's col-
league Mr. A. Holder has not yet given us the satires and
epistles. This Ι much regi-et for other reasons, and because
we are promised a fuller account there of the codices employed
in both portions of the work.

Keller’s theory of the relations of the several manuscripts
and the readings of the scholiasts to one another, and of
their comparative importance‚ is so complicated that I can
hardly realise it to myself. Agree with it Ι cannot3 for it
leads him to place in the more interpolated classes the oldest
Bernese and the ‘ antiquissimus Blandinius '. The general
opinion of late critice seems to me indisputably true, that this
Bernese is far the best of existing codices ε it appears to be at
least a century older than any of the rest3 and it was just in
that interval that designed interpolation began to be rife.
‘Unfortunately it is very incomplete: it wants twelve whole
odes and portione of more than twenty other odes or epodes:
of the rest of Horace it contains only the first three satires
and the Ars.

Ι do not pretend to decide on the relative merits of the
other Swiss and of the Paris MSS. 3 nor would it Ι think be

easy to do εο. But no editor of Horace can forbear to offer
an opinion on the long-lost ‘ Blandinii ’ of Cruquius, by which
the criticism of Horace is at once so greatly complicated and
