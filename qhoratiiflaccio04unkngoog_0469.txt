ofthe whole osu-at nee being the snme, nnd the secred isle ofsmothrsoe, a
centro-point of common pilgrimge, the Invinias of latium met there as
friends nnd brethren, with the ancient. Gergithinns, os Mount Ida, both people
of similar fiith ond institutions. 'l'be old temple nt Samothrace continued ιο
the last the grsnd snnotusry ιο nll the notione dniming deseent from the
ancient stoek. Philip fell in love with Olympiae, says Plutnmh, on moeting
ber there, whitber both bnd gone ιι the same time to be initiator! into the
myster-ies of the island. Perseus, bis last denoendnnt, took refuge there ne
the most inviolsble of all sanctuaria, and enjoyed full protection so long ss he
did not venture ιο quit its precinere. But tbe most striking proof of the
respect felt 1)] the Itsliotee for these deifies is ιο be found in the eimumsnnce
that Marcellus sent ιο their shrine one-half the nwures of nrt captured nt
the sack of Syracuse, the other half to Rome, being the first Greek works
employed in tbe decoration of that city. Herodotus (iii. 37) speaks of the
cubiti ns being the sons¹ of Hephaestos (Pan), and {ming n temple. into
which none were allowed ιο enter, ιι Memphis, eontiguoue ιο thet of their
father. Their figures, be sdds, were like the Phoenicium Pataeci, or ns the
Pygmiee were usually depicted. Now it ie a. remarkable eoincidence that the

pyrnmid into tn Etruscan picture is very interesting, ne it displsys another
traee os that intercourse with Egypt so visible in many other remaine of that

similar buildings of their own, only modified aster the natione] tante, the
grandest example of which wne the tomb of Porsena, described 1)] Varro
