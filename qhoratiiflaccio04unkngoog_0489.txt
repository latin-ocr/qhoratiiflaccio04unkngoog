Insubres and Conomnni upon the Mincio. Of the 001oe 536,ooo men ure said
to have fallen in the actium aud the victor commemorated his success by
building n temple to Juno Sospita, according to hie vow made on the eve of
the bettle. 'l'he horse wne the recognized emblem of Gallia, und therefore is
regularly stamped upon the autonomous coinage of the people. In the triumph
ot· Scipio Nasica, u few years later, over the eume foce, herde of the mpuued
hos-m formed e conspicuous portion of the spoils peraded through the euecta
of Rome (Lev. xxxii. 30, xxxvi. 46). This Lupus wne probably the eon of
Cethegus, as the modeety of republican timeo forced people to emblazon ou
their oculs the glories of their eires, not their own actual exploits. From the
coincidence of date, he may very well have been the Lupus whom Lucilius
attached in his Satires. Surd. (Wutertou.)

js. Δ. Socim-ne. A spirited pertrait, but of the Roman period, from
which, indeed, by far the larger proportion os all euch hetdo of the philoco-
phero actually have emmted. Sardonyx. (King.)

spis. B. Hamus, reeting hio hund on a long cuducemi, hnving hio folded
chlamys thrown across hie arms and possed behind hie beck. He is beerded,
and depicted ae man arrived at suu maturity, for oo this god of Wiedorn is invu-
riubly represented in au werlu of the urchnic school. There is good reason to

came the guide of Prium was the caune of the later ages mting him in amore
juvenile type, which also better befitted hio other character as meeeenger of
the gods. This intaglio, of exquisite delicacy, ie a musterpiece in the earliest
Greek manner. San-d. (Beverley.)

All. Δ. Cunus, seated on u throne, is giving her final instructions to her
foster-son Triptolemus, whom ohe ie deepntching in her own serpent-car to
instruct the nativee of Attica in agriculture. She does this, in return for the
hospitality shown her by Celeus, king of the country, when she traversed it in
quest of her daughter. This pretty subject, in the Roman manner, ie cut on
u plasma, the ancient impie, the choice of material being clearly dictated by
the belief mentioned in Orpheus (“ uthica? v. 264), that the fur-mer preying
with euch a gem on hio linger would obtain showero ut will from heaven.
