Boox 11.] THE ILLUSTRATIONS. 405

Coffer of Cypselus, “ Ajsx drsgging away Cassandra from the statue os Athene,
over which is the inscription Ala< κασσάνδραν ἀπ’ Adustae Anaphe ἵλεω ” (Pausan-
V. 19). Or again, its prototypo may have been the perulam to the “ Ajux
struck by lightning,’' which even in Pliny's day was one of the sights at Per-
gamos. It was by Apollodorus the Athenian, noticed by the histor-ian as the
very earliest puinter (he flourished in the 93rd olympiad, or n.c. 408), whose
works srrested the eye. (Plin. xxxv. 36. 1.) 'l'his gem, which is in the
later Etruscan style, is also particularly interesting for the eccui-acy with
which all the details of the hero’s armoni· are made ont. It will be obser-ved
that the breastplste is decorated with two inhid serpents raising themselves up
towards the neck. This explains Homer’s account of s similar, only more
elaborate, decoration on the cuirsss of Agamemnon, the three serpente in
ucello μέλανος sunnio arranged upon it on each side ‘with the same subordination
to its shape (11. xi. 25). Bnnded agate. (King.)

V. A. Tim Dmmrmc Bunn, girt with ivy and standing upon the thyrsus, a
symbol introduced to certify the signifieance of the representation. Dio-
nysos-Sabazios being always represented with the horne oi* a bull, it may be
inferred that the animal itself was the primitive type of the god. It may,
indeed, have been the sacred bull of Indis transported into Gneece with thc
other paraphernalia. (like the linyam) of the Mysteries, which the Greeks
themselves had for once the honesty to confess were direct importations from
the former country. “ Dionysos '’ being no more than Damnioi (s title of
Siva) Grecised, it was but natural he should bring with him the animal, Gan,
his special attribute at home. As for the explanation that Dionysosis figured
with horns, from having first taught the use of oxen in tillage, it may be set
down without further inquiry to the account of the rationalius of the latest
ages of Greeee. Now and then in history, the original Sive peeps out in hin
Hellenic successor in a manner strangely at variance with the usual character
of the jouy god3 when, for example, he appears as the Dionysos Omestes, to
whom Themistocles was forced by the diviners to offer in sacrifice the three
sons of sinduno, Xerxes’ own sister, who had been captured on the eve of
the battle of Salamis. (Plutarch.)

The name of the pretended eng-rever, Hyllus, bas been interpolated in the
field by s modern hand to enhance the sellim-price of this magnificent gem.
