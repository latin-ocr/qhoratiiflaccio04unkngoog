wound was variously reported. Homer merely says (11. H. 718) 81108 8110
Greeks left him behind 08 Lemnos “suffering from the bite os the baleful
serpent ;” and the scholiast adds in explanation 81108 110 was thus punished for
having overthrown the 018111· of the ‘⁶ 30111011” Minerva of the island. This
version is the one adopted by the Etmscan artists, who delightcd in repre-

to Hercules when he kindled the pyre for him on Mount OEta never to reveal
the burying-plnce of his ashes, 110 at last did so at 8110 entreaty of the Grecian
chiefs, evading his promise by πονηρίης 011 8110 01108 with 1110 soot. 'l'his soot

The 1101110 “ Βο0811110 ” 11100011 so conspicuously in the field is certainly 81108
of the artabe, though 00 certainly not that of the enyraver of the gem.
Boethus is named among-st the four most eminent silver-chasers, celatores on
record, by Pliny (xxxiii. 66), who says that some of 1110 works were then to
be 00011 111 8110 8011111Ιο of Mnerva 08 Lindus. Pausanias further informs us
that he was a Carthaginien, mentioning 00 something noteworthy his 31111011

Elis (V. 17. 4). 18 10, therefore, more than probable that 81110 01111100, the
work of a good hand in the times of Augustus, is 0 copy of some particularly
admired emblema by that old master, whose 018 hed by that time, as Pliny
notioes, been entirely lost, and its productione, 111 consequence, become 01101·-

ccelaturoe in onyx had replaced those in silver for the decoration of 1111180, sud
were usually exact reproductions of them. Nay, more, the appropriateness of
the moral would lead 110 to suspect 81108 81110 “Punishment of Philoctetes ”
might have adorned one of the very Lindian 10000 of which Pliny speaks.
