Boox 1v.] THE ILLUSTRATIONS. 431

XII. A. Vmws, fully draped like Juno, and, therefore, to be sup-
posed appearing here in thejoint character of the Laconian Aphrodite—Hera,
mentioned by Pausanias (iii. 13, 9), to whom women offered sacrifice at
their marriage. 'I'he goddess leansagainst a column, emblem of stability,
and holds forth a persume-jar, alabastrum, the “parvus onyx '⁹ of the text.
The material of such vases was not the gem of the same name, but the oriental
alabaster then larg-ely exported from Egypt for the purpose, as Pliny informs
us. Few gem-works can be found to equal this magnificent Roman intaglio,
either in the drawing of the figure, or the masterly and noble treatment os
the drapery. Sard. (Beverley.)

XII. s. Sum-01«, the received mode of depicting a larva, or ghost,
leaning pensively against an amphora, and holding out the lecythus, oil-flask,
that indispensable accompaniment of every Grecian burial. These two
vessels held the wine and oil, the libatione poured upon the funeral pile. It
would seem that all the vases used at the fimet-al rites were deposited aster-
wards in the tomb‚ as things not to be profaned by subsequent employment in
the uses of life. Greek style. Calcedony. (Kestner. Imp. Gem.‚II. 59.)

XIII. Δ. Cum), with fiice averted, “pour-ing cold water ’' upon his blazing
torch, and reluctantly quenching its flame. Of his quiver he has made aseat,
to imply that he has no further occasion for his arrows. A very obvious
allegory, and embodied with much tsstefulness in this pretty little cameo.
(Demidoff. Imp. Gem. 11. 57.)

XIII. s. Two Curms, who have been contending for the possession os
Psyche. She flies into the hands of the victor,‚bearing the palm-branch, in-
dicating his triumph, wbilst his vanquished rivel is seated in an attitude of
despair, his hands tied behind his back, and bound to a column. A device

prettily auguring success in love over all rivale to the bear-er. Sard. (Demi-
doff. Imp. Gem. 11. 65.)

XIV. A. Vtamur, erecting a trophy commemorating a triumph of Greeks
over some barbarian enemy, as is manifestet] by the strange fsshion of the arms
composing it. 'I'he double pilum, with its monstrously elongated iron, the
national weapon of Sout-hern Italy, warrants the conjecture that one of her
nations, like the Lucani, or Brutti, eterna] enemies of the Greek colonies in
that region, may be intended by this composition. This singular weapon, to
judge stom the broad leather tbong, amentum, fastened to it, perhaps repre-
sents the “polished aclis '⁹ of Virgil’s Oscans (AEn. vii. 730) :—

“Teretes sunt aclides illis
Tela, sed haec lento mos est aptare flagello.” ¹

¹ This explanation is supported by the traditioni-y oemunt of the aclis given by
Servius, ⁸⁸ that it was a stout truncheon, clavus, a cubit and a half long, with a spike at
each end, and tiu-own by means of a thong or cord.
