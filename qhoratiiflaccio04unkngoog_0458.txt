same action as upon the coins of Phaestum at the earliest appearance of tlte
type. From this fact it may be safely regarded as the copy of some ancient
and much admired piece of sculpture.

lv, A. Ponrnrumn, Muse of Eloquence and Rhetoric settled, and making
with her hand the gesture that indicates her office.

‘⁸ Signat cuncta manu, loquitur Polyhymnia gestu.'’

ns Ausonias describes her in his list of the characteristic attitudes of the Sisters
Nine. She is wrapped from head to font in a loose linen robe, because she
presides also over Mystery and Fable. It is to this function ofhers that allusion
is made by the sepulchral cippus supporting the little naked bey, that natural
type in all times, from Greek to Gothic, of the disembodied human soul. In
this design, therefore, the Muse is pictured as meditating upon the history of
the departed hero before whose tomb she is seated. In another gem, the
Sacrifice of Polyxena, the soul of Achilles is similarly typifled by this naked
infant, squatted ‘⁴ pilliduIa rigidula, medula ” upon the summit of his
monument. Polyhymnia can-ies a fan (or, in modern phrase, a screen), made
as then used in the shape of an ivry-leaf. This instrument (ventur-olo) eon-

the manner of Lysander's death, preserved in Plutarch. The giant protende
for a shield a lion’s hide wrapped about his left arm, whilst with his right
hand he prepures to burla rock against his opponent; the very attitude in-
tended by our poet’s “minaci Porphyrion εἵμαθ’ The expression was eer-
tainly suggested to him by the sight of the prototype of this gem, a subject
often repeated in glyptie art. Antique pasto from a Greek original. (Dr.
Nott. Imp. Gom. 1. 63.)

V. A. Vre-rosv, carrying a trophy, and holding forth a wreath‚ standing
upon a terrestrial globe placed upon a Bacchic altar, which is decorated with
masks and a tiger-chariot. Two Parthians, easily recognized by their
costume, kneeling as suppliants, offer to the goddess two legionary standai-ds.
This interesting design is unmistakablya contemporary work, commemorating
the recovery by Ventidius of the Roman standai-ds lost by Onasus in his ill-
stan-ed invasion of Parthia. Their recovery was esteemed by Augustus the
