sody of the language as well as Horace, and would have
abhorred a false quantity as much as he. Peerlkamp pro-
nounoes the 3111 stanza of 11 20 to be spurious, among other
reasons because Horace would not have written superni. But
if Horace, so well-acquainted with ImcretiuS, would not have
followed him in making the e short; still less would a writer
of N ero’s age. He condemns a large portion of 1 12. Ο, but
Quintilian quotes from this portion: ‘ tant pis ’ for Quintilian ;
then Quintilian too is spurious. It is fortunate that Bentley
has only once or twice, and then in the case of single lines,
given his weighty support to this doctrine of interpolated
verses and poems. Ritter and Keller have shewn throughout
a praiseworthy abstinence from this facile way of displaying
critical acumen, as well as Orelli before them.

The text of Horace however as it is handed down in all
known MSS. I believe to be in a far less satisfactory con-
dition than many English editors suppose. Every one,
whether he likes it or not, must introduce conjectures into his
text, sometimes those of a known scholar, sometimes out of
some interpolated codex or old edition. It is in vain for Mr.
Macleane to exclaim that to desert the MSS. in any known
case he holds to be inexcusable. We find in his text as in
that of most others pure conjectures like the following: Cam.

‘ this is probably the true reading3 . ·. . but how this should
have got into all the known MSS. and nearly every edition,
I do not understand’: And many other readings have got
into his text without his understanding3 and yet he tells us
in his prefiaeoe that he has in no sinyle instcmce adopted a con-
jecture of Bentley’s or any body else's3 that *Q desert the
MSS. and resort to conjecture in the case of this author he
holds to be inexcusable; and the like. Far different is the
