querqueta, Quintus, Quintilius ’ but ‘Quinctius ’ in conformity
with inscriptions: ‘ mercennarius, pilleolus, comissabere, holus,
holusculum ’3 nor have Ι avoided variety in ‘ fenore, faenere '

‘ foenere ’ Ι believe to be barbarous: ‘ formidolosus, formidu-
losuS, pinna, penna ’. I have not deserted the MSS. even in
those cases where variety was the rule in classical timae,
such as the assimilation of prepositions and the use of es or is
in the accus, plural: my reasons Ι have stated fully in the in-
troduction to my Lucretius. Even the best editore, such as
Haupt, who attempt to introduce an arbitrary consistency, are
osten inconsistent, often too give us what Horace certainly did
not write: Keller's edition of the odes is a more flagrant in-
stance of this arbitrari-nese. Of course I am aware I do not
always get from the MSS. what Horace wrote3 but that I can-
not help. Thus in half of Horace we have the guidance of the
old Bel-nese which gives us is in the accus. far oftener than
other MSS. Clearly therefore in other parts they must often
mislead us: thus in Epist. 1 20 27 our best MSS. have all ‘ de-
cembres’; but Priscian vn 85, in showing that both decembres
and decembris were in use, quotes our verse to prove that
Horace here used the latter form. The satires and epistles,
perhaps from having been less frequently copied than the
odes, appear to me to retain in the MSS. a form somewhat
more antique than the odes do: the Bernese, as was said
above, has only the first three satires and the Ars of this half
of Horace3 and in the Ars 114 it once retains the nomin.
divom and in these satires and the Ars has five instances of
the enclitic st,- all of which of course I keep. Doubtless
Horace oftener used such forms3 but it does not follow that
he always gave this os, as his contemporary Augustus on the
other hand in his res gestae always has us after another u.
Again, though no doubt he always pronounced est as an encli-
tic st, when otherwise an inadmissible elision would be the
consequence, as in Oarm. 1 3 37 ardui est, 1v 3 21 tui est, 24
&town eet (pronounced iuuet, with a slight nasal sound for the
m), and hundreds of similar cases, it by no means follows that
