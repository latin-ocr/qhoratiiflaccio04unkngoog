therefore making it the business of the illustrator to seek
out some graceful creation of 15116 glyptic artist’s fancy that
shall image forth the predominant thought of the whole piece
with an easily recognizable allusiveness. Pine, in most cases,
evaded the difficulty by inventing‚ and not very happily‚ de-
signs of his own to tell ‚the story required3 I, on the other
hand, have honestly and eourageously faeed it, and lavished
over my pag-es a wealth of picturesque and symbolical compo-
sitions whose beauty and instructiveness will, it is hoped,
obtain indulgence for the straining some few amongst them
will have to endure from 15116 reader’s ingenuity before they
fit the sense they at least embellish‚ if not illustrate.

It remains for me to indicate the chief sources which have
furnished means in abundance, whether well or ill employed,

taste towards the remaining treasures in the Museum 66666,
especially as they can at last be studied there with so much
facility and pleasure. Another quar-ter whence great assist-
