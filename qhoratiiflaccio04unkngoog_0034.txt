made, such as Ventosum ct orbem. But years ago on reading
in Ennius’ Epicharm. fiug. v11 Vahlen, ‘ Haece propter Iuppi-
ter suut ista quae dico tibi, Quoniam mortalis atque urbes
beluasque omnis iuvat ’‚ I felt instinctively that Horace hed
these lines in his mind: and perhaps others from the same
poem now lost.

111 29 5⁶ eripe te morae, N ec [Ne] semper udum Tibur et
Aefulae Declive contempleris arvum cet! :Lachmamm from
utter' ignorance of what the poet 1s speaking of, has positively
assassinated this beautiful passage by reading Hic for N ec.
And yet this has been adopted by Haupt and Peerlkamp: the
comments of the latter are lamentable to peruse. But in
Epist. 1 7 29 Bentley’s famous nitedula for vomenta desei-ves
all praise3 it is brilliant3 is what Horace ought to have
written 3--but I sadly fem· did not write, not from ignorance
probably, but because he had in his thoughts some old-world
fable whose foxes were not as our foxes3 though Lachmann
passionately supports it, and Haupt and many others have it
in their texts. Bentley’s Horace is a. great monument of
power and learning3 but from the nature of the case few of
his 700 or 800 new readings have the merit which belongs to
this and others mentioned above. Very many awake in us
the same feeling of repulsion which his Milton vagaries
arouse, such as his‘ Sti-ictis 111 juvenes 1111311111116’; his‘ fixis
oculis’ for‘ siccis‘ ,against which Milton' s ‘Sight so deform
what heart of rock could long Drie-ey' d behold ’ rises up in
judgment. Others shew a hypercritical and prosaic over-
refining‚ such as ‘iterare cursus Cogor relectos ’ for ‘ relictos ⁹,
made by N. Heinsius as well, who errs in the same way from
want of poetical insight3 and so perhaps 111 the Ars 423 ‘artis
litibus’ for ‘ ata-'is’ : others again are quite grutuitous, such as
‘ Fulmine sustulerit corusco ' for ‘caduco ⁹.

A few passages. which could not be brought conveniently
under any of the preceding heads, and which if left without
comment might excite the surprise of some readers, will now
