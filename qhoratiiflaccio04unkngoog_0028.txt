Β111 110, I find 1110 latest numbers of 1110 Rhenish Museum
admit papers of an exactly similar 10110111· and spirit, in which
odes are mutilated in 1110 111001 merciless manner. Before
Gruppe indeed Hofman Peerlkamp, a man of real learning in
his way and of much reading in 1110 later Latin poets, was
hardly less wild in his mode of dealing with 1110 01100 of
Horace and 1110 Αο110111. Some of his commenias, such as those

feels that a philologer should be something. more than a
pedania 111 1110 desk ignorant of men and things. N ear 1110

by Ovid.

as Gruppe or Peerlkamp, yet pronounce for 1110 spuriousness
either of whole odes or of many passages in 1110 01100. Βο111-
ley’s edition of Paradise Lost seems 10 1110 10 afford a 111001
valnable analogy. From a want of sympathy with Milton's
highest efforts and from his ignorance of or contempt for
many of his author's favouribe sources of knowledge, such as
1110 Italians and 1110 Romances of his own country, he 01110 0111
