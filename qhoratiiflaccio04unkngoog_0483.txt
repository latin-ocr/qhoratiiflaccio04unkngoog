the influence of Greeinn teste which modified the grotesque old god into the

of this, the latest mode of moting the subject, explains Cicero's expression,
“ Gorgonis ω palchen-imum vinctum anguibus? ‹nn-ved in ivon-y, which that
“ terrible amntenrss’ Verres, tore off from the great doorn of the Minerva of
Syracuse. This modificetion of the orig-inni Gorgoneion‚ one which converted
it from the extreme of terrific nglinem into n thing of ideal beeuty, ie univer-
