430 DESCRIPTION OF [onze.

⁰ occupatione of the ancients being carried on, when possible, under the free

heaven, a circumstance, amongst the rect, contributing to the superior delioecy
of their perception of the beautiful. There ie reason to believe that these
subjecta representing special occupatione were the signata os persons actually
carrying on euch professione. Good Roman work. Sard. (Duc de Luynee.)

VIII. Β. Semo Amemus, the elder. His head ie covered with thoe-udo,
leuthern ekull-cap, an ingenious expedient of the eng-raver's to conceal the
complete baldnees which disfigured the porti-eit of thie hero. sard. (King).

lx. Gonnus in a cer (titensa), drawn by elephanta, each one guided by its
merhout, seeted on ite neck. This remarkable type ie shown by the legende
accompanying it upon the consecration medule of Faustina, to have expressed

the idea of eternity. Yeuow eard„ (Praun.)

X. Nnctssus contemplating his own cherma in the liquid mirror of a
bunnia-min. The accessory figures ingeniously tell the story. The Cupid
perched on the column beside him symbolizee the love with which the youth
is inspired at the sight of his beauteous counterpart below; whilet the eylmn
goddess, Diana, erected upon a rustic altar of rough etones, with the skulle
of victims at her feet, declares the ecene to be laid in the recenses of a forest.
'rho timbrel hung from the bnnch overhead gives ue to understand that Nar-
cissus has strayed into its depthe during a Bacchic revel, a variatim: on the
common legend which makee him lose his way when hunting. The style of
this fine intaglio, eost and voluptuous in the exn-eme, belongs ω the age of
Hadrian. sard. (Duc de Luynes.)

XI. Α. J tim-run descending in all hie glory, midst a ehower os thunder·
holte, upon Semele, who falls liseless before the insupportable brighmees os
his advent. The god is represented with πίῃς-ε, that most annual ex-
pression of the iden of omnipreeence, with which all archaic art, whether
Greek or Etruscan, following its Assyrian models, Pliny'e ‘⁸ Asiatic School‚”
loved to equip every divinity. Winckelmann (“ Pieri-ee Graveee de Stoech,”
p. 64) terme this design the perfection of Etruscan αγις remnrking that it
would be difficule in any work, of any period, to find the drapery eo delicately
rendered. Antiqua peste. (Berlin).

xl. ιι. Vnus Murum, or, more probably, the N ymph Leucothea, givet
of fizir westher to mariners, the Galene of Tryphon'e well-known epigram.
She ie depicted in the act of ewimming through the placid πανοῦ, on which
account this lig-ure, a fizvourite subject with the Romane, ie usually mietakcu
for a Leander, but besides that the character of the head is unmistekably
feminine, the true significance of the type is placed out of doubt by a denarius
os the firmily Crepereia, bearing for obverse this identical buet3 for reverse,

Neptune in his car ruling the fleas. (Berlin.)
