INTRODUOTION xxiii

Syrtes, well and good. Most editors do n ,t even allude to
the difficulty: Orelli says that Poenus is for Tyrius and Sido-
nius. But in Horace’s time Poenus could no more be used for
Tyrian or Sidonian than Yankees now for English3 though in
the mouth of an Indian ‘ English’ became ‘ Yankees’3 and in
that of an antique Roman Φοῖνιξ passed into Poenus. And Ty-
118118 and Sidonians did not dwell on the shores of the Bosporus,
If in a corrupt text, say that of Shakespeare, one found it said
that the Calais sk ipper fears nothing beyond the straits of
Gibraltar, one perhaps would first make 8 desperate effort to
turn the sti-aits of Gibraltar into those of Dover3 as the scho-
liasts would make the Bosporus into the Syrtes. He would
then bethink himself that Shakespeare uses Calais 12 timeS,
and (88 18 the fact) that the first folio spells it Gallice, 081118,
081166, and Calis: he would then remember that even Fox
always spoke of Cadiz 88 08168, and cry εὕρηκα, it is the 08168
01 Cadiz skipper who fears nothing beyond the sti-aits of
Gibraltar. But Shakespeare is 80 corrupt, while the MSS.
contain every letter of Horace! Editors therefore do not
care to recollect that the Thyni, Thuni or 'Phoeni lived all
along the shore of the Bosporus, and to accept Lachmann’s
Thymw or Thoewus for Poemae .· a corruption perhaps as old as
the author's lifetime. Yet even this I have not put into the
text.

Some of these conjectures restore as I believe what Horace
wrote, though Ι must repeat that I 8111 well aware how apt we
are to misapprehend him from our ignoranoe of the sources
both native and Greek, from which he derived the motives
which determined his choice. Let me give an instance 01 two
of what Ι mean: 081111. 111 4 45 we read ‘ Qui terram inertem,
qui mare temperat ventosum, et urbes regnaque tristia Divos-
que mortalisque turbas Imperio regit 1111118 aequo '. Here
Bentley asks ‘ iam dic obsecro quid sibi velit urbes et mortales
turbas .- enimvero hoc ineptum est et tautologia mera ἐ and
for wrbae he reads wmbras, which has been accepted by many,
Haupt among others: various other conjectures have been
