INTRODUCTION xxi

always been ready to defer to him there 3 but of the hundreds
of conjectures which he either made himself or adopted or ap-
proved, few indeed are those Ι have admitted into the text,
feeling as Ι do how ignorant we are of the origin and drift of
many of the poet's allusione. Yet in Serm. 11 4 19 Ι could not but
accept ‘ musto Falerno ' ; and Ι will mention a. few instances

where emendations more than plausible have been made,
though Ι have not ventured to introduce them into the text:

Germ. 1 23 5 ‘ Nam seu mobilibus veris inhorruit Adventus
foliis, seu virides rubum Dimovere lacertas, Et corde et genibus
tremit ’. From habit many of us look on the first verse as
highly poetical τ it seems to me scarcely classical, and surely
it is not common sense. The fawn's beart is said to beat, its
knees to shake, if the advent of spring shivers with (or t0, or
whatever the construction may be) the lightly moving leaves;
or the lizards stir the bmmble. The scholiasts explain it as
an hypallage for 6 folia. inhorruerunt adventu veris ’. 'I'he
advent of spring then must mean when the 6 genitabilis aura
favoni ’ begins to blow freshly and stendily3 that is, on some
day iu the month of February. But in the Italian forests the
lightly moving leaves come almost or quite as late as in the
English; and the zephyr blowing steadily for days together
would be the last thing to startle a fawn. Now just suppose
with Bentley and some others before him, that velus took the
place of vupms: then adveutwm or ad ventum would at once be
changed to adventus. Then how admirably ‘ mobilibus vepris
inhorruit Ad ventum foliis ’ tallies with what goes before and
what comes after.

Carm. 1 2 39: the‘ special pleading of Orelli and others in
favour of 6 Mauri peditis ' had once more weight with me then
it now has. N either his illustrations of pedes, which strike
me as missing the real point, nor the ‘ Gaetuloe urbes, genus
insuperabile bello ' of Virgil, at all tend to convince me that
‘ Marsi peditis' is not far finer and more appropriate. Ib.
