442 DESCRIPTION OF [sn-r.

IV. A. Mun, of extremely trucident aspect: probably intended for the
character of Tyrent in the pieee, Busiris or Thous. Surd- (Beverley.)

IV. n. Tu Come Soccus, 'erossed en calare with the pedum, 'l'hslin's
well-known bndge. The addition of the palm of Victory sugurs the success
of the owner of the signet upon the stage of Comedy. The style of the en-
grnving is Greek, end of that finisbed character which temptas us to assign it
to the ege of Menander, ω whom indeed the gem may possibly heve belonged.
Black agate. (Beverley.)

V. Δ. Μιιοοιῐ, wearing his pensus nnd chlamys, ss though about to svart
on ajourney. The attitude here depicted, and of rare occurrence, is interest-
ing, ss showing the mode of wearing the garment, with the weight, ῥοΐσκός,
et its corner, intended to make it sit better to tbe person. 'rho mmo Dion-
con'dee, in the field, hss of course been' laid bold of to ascribe this work to the
famous eng-rever under Augustus, although there is no vnlid resson why it
should not heve designsoed any other of the innumernble Asiatic Greeks
bearing that very populu· name st the same period. This gem has enjoyed
its celebrity for three centurias, having first been notieed in the possession of
Fulvius Ursinus, then of Tigrini, and lutly of Stosch‚ who sold it to Lord
Holdernesse for 1000 guinensl from whom it passed by bequest into the
Mnrlborougb Cebinet. Serd.

V. n. Busrs or Auousrus um Aaron, conjugata, fecing thet of Lepidus.
The lituu-v and ammaum, in the field, expreoe the diguitis· bomo hythe latter
two of the Triumvirate, Antony belonging to the college of Augias, and
Lepidus being then Pontifex Maximus. 'l'his gem, therefore, must bave been
engrnved about the time of our poet’s journey to Brundisium. Serd. (Lippert,

11. 575.)

VI. Α. Ermum Lucumo in his robes of state. 'l'bis wss the title of the
hereditnry priest-king who ruled ench of the twelve cities forming the Etruscan
Consederation. Maecenas was the representative of Elbiun, the last Lucumo
of Volterrn, who fell in the battle on the lake Vadimon, n. c. 310, which gave
the death-blow ω the Etruscan power. The ancient chief in this his portu-ait
renim the Asinio coetume of his Lydiam moestors, for his peculia esp and
long fringed tunic are nearly identioel with those of regul personages on the
Assyrinn monuments. The roysl house of Sardis boasted of its descent from
Suadam the Babylonia: Hercules, and hence styled themselves Sandonidae,
litemuy mmhted by the Greek “Heraclida” Our Lucumo beers n long
sceptro, much resembling a esduoeus. 'l'he gost before him probably elludes to
his sacerdotal character, ss does the raven underneath ω his ca· officio profes-
sion of nugor. This figure belongs οο the very earliest class of Etruscan works,
being one of those cbesings in gold, forming the bend of s. ring, the desig-ns
