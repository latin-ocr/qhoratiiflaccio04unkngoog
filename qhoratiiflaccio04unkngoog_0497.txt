now be termed an epicureen sense, rendered himself extremely popular at the
court of Dionysius the Elder, and of his successor. This gem, however, does
not descend from his times, the ingenious allegory of the accompsniments be-
tmying the taste of the Roman period, the pertrait nevertheless may be sc-
cepted as authentic, being doubtless copied from some contemporary statue.
A glauce at Pliny's list will show thet the making statues of philosopher-s had
become a regular department of the sculptor’s profession, even as early as the
date of Aristippus. Antique peste. (Blaene.)

XVII. n. DroensnS, ensconced within his dolium, or great eil-jar, exwtly
such a vessel as those still used throughout Southern Europe. He hss with
him the bsdges of his sect, the regged suff, and the cur, whence came the
appellation of ‘⁸ Cynic.'’ Before him sits s disciple ready to take down on a
papyrus roll the wisdom that falls from his master-’s lips. 'l'he initials cut
upon the vessel are those os some Roman of Hadrian’s times, who had adopted
the philosopher for his model. Sard. (Thorweldsen. Imp. Gem. IV. 82.)

XVIII. A. Germ aiding the pedsgooeue, and enthroned in the magisterial
cathedra, whence he administers punishment to a stupid pupil with the good
old instrument yet in use in Scotlsnd under the nune of tame. The gravit)-

of the master, and comio distr-ees and puin of the scholar are here depicted
with the utmost humour. Sard. (Dr. Nott. Imp. Gem. IV. 31.)

XVIII. s. Cmucsus plaoed between two ears of bear-ded wheet (triti-

tsglio is beautifully finished, notwithstanding the extreme hardness of the
gem, a purple sapphire, the true Oriental amethyst. (Maskelyne.)

XIX. A. Summus, sested on a rock, is, with great complncency, solseing
himself with s drsught from his capacious scyphus. To leave no doubt as to
the personage intended, the artist has placed in his left hand s thyrsus en-

twined with an ornamentul bundenu, the Bacchio taenia. Ser-d. (Dr. Nott.
Imp. Gem. IV. 41.)

XIX. B. Pon-mss (Sumo or Emmu) sested, and playing upon sn in-
strument of many stringe, probably the Lydisn barbiton. 'l'his represents.-
tion, so mrely to be met with in snt-ique remains, gives much additional velue
to this gem, which itselss in point of art, is sn almost matchless example of
the early Greek style. Its high antiquity is declared by its belonging to the
class of signets anterior t04the use of seul-ringis, being engrsved upon s sce-
rsbeoid. Burnt Surd. (Woodhouse Gems. Brit. Mus.)

XX. A. duwe, lesning upon his staff. 'I'he plinth resting upon hisdouble
head, and which, st first sight, seems an unmeaning adjunct, will, by invert-
