PREFACE vii

take, in good hope of success, to illusbrabe my author's ideas

by precisely the same pictorial renderings of them as he
would himself have selected had such a method of enhancing

the atti-actions of a book been fashionable in his day. And
this assei-tion, presumptuous as it may appear 150 15118 unini-
tiated, may be substantiabed wirla little difficulty. All persons
conversant with ancient art are awai-e 1511815 engraved gems
filled exactly 15118 same place in 15118 Roman world as prints on
paper do in the modern: 811 subjecte,

“Quidquid agunt homines, votum, timor, ira, volupoesss'

being embodied in their medium, and by means of impres-

branches of creative art, statne-ry, painting, numismatics3
nay, go far beyond them all in what relates 150 religione
neeges, porti-uitare, domestic life, and 15118 creatione of fancy
and of humour. And, for my special purpose, their representa-
tions of all such objecizs possess 15118 inestimable advantage of
being already reduced, and presented 150 15118 eye in 15118 form
sanctioned beforehand by antique teste as 15118 best adapted
for 15118 embellishment of 15118 printed page.

Gems moreover have a peculiar claim 150 be enlisted in 15118
service of 1511815 poet, who was 15118 favoni-ite and intimate
friend—

‘quem vocas “ dilecte ” Maecenas'—

of one, himself 15118 most enthusiastio ama-bem· in them, and 15118
