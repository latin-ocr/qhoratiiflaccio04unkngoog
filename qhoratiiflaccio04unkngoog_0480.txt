436 DESCRIPTION OF [mon.

tulus, in his goatskin cloak‚ bas just discovered. Sard. (Dr. Nott. Imp.
Gem. 11. 66.)

VIII. A. Locusr, mounted upon agoat. The explanation of this strange
companionship is to be found in the ancient notion that the shape of the locust
suggested the idea of the phallus, and indicated the purpose sor which Nature
intended—it to serve as an amulet. This is placed out of doubt by the example
publi-hed by Caylus (Rec. d'Antiq. vi. pl. 41), an agate figure of the insece,
life-siae, its base engraved with a legend that explains its influence and des-
tination, Anu sxa noir rumpam-ort, 0‘ Locusta, serva penem Tisicntis.”
From the same notion sprung its actual employment in medicine in analogous
diseases, mentioned by Pliny: “ Locustarum suffitu stranguriae levantur?
The goat was very appropriately chonen by Scopas for the vehicle of his cele-
brated statue of Aphrodite Pandemos at Elis, whilst be seated the Urania on
a tortoise‚ as Pausanias saw them. lt is, therefore, tolerably certain that the
device before us was intended for a taliman to be worn by some ‘⁶ Amyntas
of Cos‚’' who desired to secure himself in the good maces of the amorous old
lady, who so humorously complains of Horace's coldness. Sard. (King.)

vm. n. Ass, employed in working a flour-mill. The upper-stone, shaped
as a dice-box, and which contained the grain sor grinding‚ fitted loosely upon
the conical surface of the netlner-stone3 both being bewn out of a rough lara.
'rho corn descending between the inner sur-faces of the two, when the upper
was made to revolve on its axis, was rapidly triturated by their friction. Tho
machine was set in motion by means osa long pole fixed horisontally at top,
to which the yoke for the beust propelling it was attached. The crau placed
so conspicuously on its summit was the symbol of Mercury, and, therefore,
regularly set up in all bakebouses. Sardonyx. (Vescovali. Imp. Gem. lv, 79.)

IX. Α. Surus Pontem, the “ dux Neptunius '³ of this ode, long master of
the aeas, and the terror of Rome. The gem is inscribed with the name of
Agathangelus, usually supposed ita engraver, but much more probably its
proprietor only; and who, as bearing one of those significative and suspicions
appellations given as a rulc ω slaves, may reasonably be concluded some
favourite freedman of the “Son of Neptune.” This fine sard, Winckelmann
states, was found, set in a gold ring weighing an ounce, deposited in a tomb
discovered in the environs of Rome some years before 1760. (Berlin.)

lx. s. Caunus attacking the serpent guardian of the sacred founffin, and
the destroyer of all his Pboenician crew, who had gone in ignorance ω draw
water from it. 'l'heir flate is ingeniously intimated by the overturned pincher
lying in the soreground. Etruscan work of the most finisbed kind. (Berlin.)

xli. Scau, dean-oying with tho madar of his wrecked amp ,ome un-
lucky mai-incr who lias been seized by the sea-dogs and serpents forming her
