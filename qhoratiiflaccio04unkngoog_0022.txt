xii PREFACE

of Mr. Maskelyne, Professor of Mineralogy at Oxford‚ who has
permitted me to search for whatever best suited my require-
ments in his very extensive collection of electrotypes, formed
with equal teste and judgment from the choicest gems in every
important cabinet, whether national or private, now in exist-
ence. Lastly‚ it is necessary to mention that some of the oute,
taken from gems in my own possession, have made their ap·
pearanoe in other book3‚ but are introduced here when nothing
equally appropriate to the place was obtainable from any
other quarter3 and also that wherever no name is appended I
have been unable to ascertain the ownership of the intaglio
from which that particular cast was taken.

G. W. KING.
