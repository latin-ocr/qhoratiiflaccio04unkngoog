INTRODUOTION xxxi

necessary, they will surprise perhaps many of my readers, as
all recent English editors without exception have ‘ Rumpat '
and ‘ vetet ' and so have the best known German commenta-
tors, Orelli, Ritter and others. who Galatea was, or what
Horace meant by entering into such curicus details of augury
in the mingled pathos and sportiveness of these first stanzas,
we do not know ; but 88 explained by Lambinus and Bentley
the sequence of the argument is clear enough. May the god-
less be guided on their way by the pam-a, the calade, etc. : 811011
omens are fatal for a traveller: a serpent too darting athwart
your path is cause for breaking off a journey begun. Here
‘ rumpat ⁹, as Bentley shows, has no proper sense, though
Macleane quietly observes ‘ Bentley appears to have mistaken
the meaning of the passage’. Though ‘ rumpat ’ has got into
most MSS. by atti-action of the preceding subjunctives, yet pro-
perly considered the indicative has most authority on its side:
several of the best of Keller’s Paris MSS. have it; and, what
is more decisivo, the best codices of both the Acron and Por-
phyrion scholia attest it, though the inferior MSS. conceal
this by senseless interpolation and are unskilfully followed
even by the latest editor of these scholia, Hauthal. Ι, the
poet continues, a careful observer for one for whom I have
fcars, will summon from the ,east the raven and see whether
its cry is propitious. Yes‚ all is well: it has uttered its cry
on the right hand: you may journey with good fortune
wherever you list. And there both the woodpecker and the
crow by appear-ing on the lest shew that they too do not for-
bid you to set out. vetat is a conjecture of LambinuS, or 8188
of the Vatican MS. in which he says he found it; yet it is
undoubtedly true, the vetet having come from the atti-action of
the preceding subjunctives, a very common source of error in
Horace’s MSS. Otherwise the passage itself has no meaning,
and is in direct contradiction to other authorities: Cicem, de
divin. 1 83, asks ‘ cur a dextra come, a sinistra cornix faciat
ratum?’; and Plautus asin. 260 says ‘Picus et cornix ab
laeva, corvus porro (parra) ab dextera Consuadent '; and
